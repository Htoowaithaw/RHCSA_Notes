# 🛠️ System Utility Commands in Linux

## 🎯 Purpose
These basic system utility commands are used frequently in terminal-based Linux environments, especially when working without a graphical user interface (GUI). They help users check the system time, date, uptime, OS details, and perform simple operations like calculations or viewing the calendar.

These commands are essential for users who log in via terminal clients like PuTTY or SSH, where no GUI is available.

---

## ⏰ Date and Time: `date`
- Displays the current system date, time, timezone, and year.
- Often used in scripts to log timestamps or trigger time-based tasks.

---

## 🔁 System Uptime: `uptime`
- Shows how long the system has been running.
- Also shows the number of logged-in users and system load averages.

---

## 🖥️ Host Information: `hostname`
- Prints the hostname of the system.
- Useful for identifying which server you're logged into, especially in multi-server environments.

---

## 🧠 System Identity: `uname` and `uname -a`
- `uname` shows the system type (usually "Linux").
- `uname -a` provides full details: kernel name, version, build date, architecture, and hostname.
- Helpful in distinguishing between Linux distributions or Unix variants like AIX or Solaris.

---

## 📍 Location of Commands: `which`
- Displays the full path of a given command.
- Useful for confirming where a command is stored (usually in `/usr/bin`).
- Helps understand how commands are structured and which binaries or scripts are executed.

---

## 📂 Viewing All Commands: `ls -l /usr/bin`
- Most Linux system commands are stored in `/usr/bin`.
- Listing this directory shows all executable files available to users.
- You can pipe the list through a pager (like `more`) to view one screen at a time.

---

## 🔢 Counting Commands: `wc -l`
- You can count how many commands exist in `/usr/bin` using a line count tool.
- Example: There may be 1,597 command files in a typical system directory.

---

## 📅 View Calendar: `cal`
- Displays the current month and year.
- You can also view a specific month and year (e.g., September 1977).
- Typing only a year shows the calendar for all 12 months.

---

## 🧮 Binary Calculator: `bc`
- Launches a command-line calculator session.
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Useful when working in CLI-only environments without a GUI calculator.
- Type `quit` to exit the calculator mode.

---

## 📖 Learn More: `man`
- Every utility command has a manual entry accessible via the manual viewer.
- Use the manual viewer to explore available options and flags for each command.
- Helps deepen understanding and discover additional command features.
