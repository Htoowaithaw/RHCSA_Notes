# ⏰ Crontab – Scheduling Tasks in Linux

## 📌 What is Crontab?

- `crontab` stands for **cron table**, used to schedule **automated tasks** (cron jobs) in Linux.
- It helps users and administrators run repetitive tasks at predefined times and intervals.
- Rather than manually logging in to execute commands daily, `crontab` can automate this based on time rules.

## 🛠️ Crontab Command Options

| Command Option | Description                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| -e             | Edit the current user's crontab table         |
| -l             | List current crontab entries                  |
| -r             | Remove current crontab                        |

- These commands operate on a per-user basis and do not require elevated privileges unless modifying another user's crontab.

## ⚙️ Crond Service

- `crond` is the background **daemon** that reads the crontab entries and executes the scheduled tasks.
- You can **check the status**, **start**, or **stop** this service through the system service manager.
- If the service is **stopped**, your scheduled tasks will not run, even if crontab entries exist.
