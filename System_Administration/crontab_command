# ⏰ Crontab – Scheduling Tasks in Linux

## 📌 What is Crontab?

- `crontab` stands for **cron table**, used to schedule **automated tasks** (cron jobs) in Linux.
- It helps users and administrators run repetitive tasks at predefined times and intervals.
- Rather than manually logging in to execute commands daily, `crontab` can automate this based on time rules.

## 🛠️ Crontab Command Options

| Command Option | Description                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| -e             | Edit the current user's crontab table         |
| -l             | List current crontab entries                  |
| -r             | Remove current crontab                        |

- These commands operate on a per-user basis and do not require elevated privileges unless modifying another user's crontab.

## ⚙️ Crond Service

- `crond` is the background **daemon** that reads the crontab entries and executes the scheduled tasks.
- You can **check the status**, **start**, or **stop** this service through the system service manager.
- If the service is **stopped**, your scheduled tasks will not run, even if crontab entries exist.

## 📐 Crontab Entry Format

Each line in a crontab represents a scheduled task and follows a strict column format:


| Field         | Allowed Values        | Description                        |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Minute        | 0–59                   | Minute of the hour                 |
| Hour          | 0–23                   | Hour of the day (24-hour format)   |
| Day of Month  | 1–31                   | Day of the month                   |
| Month         | 1–12                   | Month (1 = January)                |
| Day of Week   | 0–7                    | 0 or 7 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc.  |
| Command       | Any shell command      | The task or script to execute      |

- Wildcards like `*` can be used to indicate "every" value (e.g., every minute, every day).

🧠 **Tip:** This format is a common Linux interview question.

## 🧪 Demonstration Summary

### ✅ Step-by-Step Example

1. Confirm current time using system date command.
2. Choose the next minute to schedule a test command (e.g., 16:21).
3. Edit crontab using the edit command.
4. Enter a line like:
   - Minute: 21
   - Hour: 16
   - Day of Month: *
   - Month: 10
   - Day of Week: *
   - Command: Output a text message to a file (e.g., "This is my first crontab entry" → saved to `crontab-entry`)
5. Save and exit the editor.
6. Wait for the scheduled minute.
7. Check the home directory for the file created by the scheduled job.
8. Verify its content to ensure the job executed successfully.
9. View active crontab entries using the list option.
10. Remove the job using the remove option.
11. Check crond service status to ensure the scheduler is running.

### 📁 Output Behavior

- If no absolute path is provided in the command, the job output is stored in the user's **home directory**.
- File creation from the job confirms that the crontab entry ran as expected.

## 🚨 Crond Service Reminder

- Even if a valid crontab entry exists, **tasks won't run** if the `crond` service is inactive.
- Always verify that the service is **active and running**.

| Remove all entries          | Remove option                        |
| Schedule jobs               | Use minute–hour–day–month–weekday    |
| Verify execution            | Check output file at scheduled time |
| Check service status        | Use system service tools             |

With `crontab`, you can automate routine maintenance, backups, data processing, report generation, and more. Mastering this tool is essential for every Linux system administrator.
