# üîê Root Password Recovery ‚Äì Method 1 and Method 2 (Advanced Notes)

When root password is lost or forgotten, it can be recovered through GRUB by entering either **Rescue Mode** or **Single User Mode**. Both methods require physical or console access and involve temporarily booting into a privileged shell to reset the password securely.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Method 1: Using Rescue Mode (Recommended)

### 1. Reboot the System
- On the GRUB 2 boot screen, select ‚ÄúAdvanced options for Red Hat Enterprise Linux‚Äù using the arrow keys.

### 2. Edit the Boot Entry
- Highlight the desired kernel version and press `e` to edit.
- Use `Ctrl + E` to move the cursor to the end of the `linux` line.

### 3. Add Rescue Mode Parameter
- Append `rd.break` to the end of the `linux` line.
- Optionally remove any `console=` or `vconsole.keymap=` parameters to avoid display issues.

### 4. Boot into Emergency Shell
- Press `Ctrl + X` to start booting with the modified parameters.
- You will drop into an emergency shell with limited functionality.

### 5. Remount Root Filesystem as Writable
- Type `mount -o remount,rw /sysroot` to allow modifications.

### 6. Enter the Real Root Environment
- Use `chroot /sysroot` to change root into the actual system environment.

### 7. Reset the Root Password
- Type `passwd root` and set a strong new password.

### 8. Trigger SELinux Relabeling
- Type `touch /.autorelabel` to ensure SELinux updates file contexts correctly on reboot.

### 9. Exit and Reboot
- Type `exit` to leave the chroot environment.
- Type `exit` again (or `Ctrl + D`) to leave the emergency shell.
- The system will reboot and perform SELinux relabeling during boot.
- You can now log in as root with the new password.

## üß© Method 2: Using Single User Mode (Alternative)

### 1. Reboot and Interrupt GRUB
- On the GRUB 2 menu, select your kernel and press `e` to edit it.

### 2. Modify Boot Parameters
- Find the `linux` line.
- Replace `ro` with `rw` to mount root as writable.
- Append `init=/bin/bash` at the end to boot directly into a bash shell.
- Optionally remove `console=` and `vconsole.keymap=` parameters.

### 3. Boot into Single User Shell
- Press `Ctrl + X` to boot with the modified parameters.
- You will enter a basic shell environment as root.

### 4. Reset the Root Password
- Run `passwd root` and enter a secure new password.

### 5. Enable SELinux Relabeling
- Run `touch /.autorelabel` to restore SELinux labels on reboot.

### 6. Reboot the System
- Run `exec /sbin/init` to reboot and resume normal system operation.

## üß† Explanation of Key Steps

- **rd.break**: Breaks the boot process before control is handed to the OS, useful for safe recovery.
- **rw**: Mounts root in read-write mode, required to make file changes like password reset.
- **init=/bin/bash**: Launches a simple bash shell without starting the full OS.
- **chroot /sysroot**: Changes the root directory to the actual system's root, allowing meaningful system commands.
- **passwd root**: Resets the root password in `/etc/shadow`.
- **touch /.autorelabel**: Ensures SELinux labels are corrected to avoid boot issues after modification.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Only perform root recovery from secure, authorized access points.
- Use a strong, policy-compliant password.
- Protect GRUB with a password to prevent unauthorized access to recovery options.
- Always perform root password resets under proper change control in production environments.

## üß™ Practice Tip

In your lab VM, test both Method 1 (Rescue Mode) and Method 2 (Single User Mode) to understand how they work. Use different kernel versions, observe SELinux relabeling, and verify login functionality after reboot.
