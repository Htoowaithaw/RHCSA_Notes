# 🧾 SOS Report (Lecture Notes)

An **SOS Report** is a diagnostic tool used on Red Hat-based systems like RHEL and CentOS. It collects vital system information—configuration files, logs, and diagnostic data—into a single compressed archive that can be shared with Red Hat support engineers to troubleshoot issues efficiently.

---

## ❓ What is SOS?

- The term "SOS" historically comes from the international distress signal, often said to mean:
  - **Save Our Ship**
  - **Save Our Souls**
- In Linux, `sosreport` follows this theme—used when the system is in trouble and you need to "call for help."

---

## 🎯 Purpose of SOS Report

- To **collect and package diagnostic and support data** in one file.
- Helps Red Hat support teams avoid asking for individual logs or configuration files repeatedly.
- Speeds up issue resolution by offering a full snapshot of system state.

---

## 📦 Package and Command

- The tool comes pre-installed on most RHEL and CentOS systems.
- Package: `sos` (version may vary, e.g., `sos-3.5`)
- Command to run: `sosreport` (must be run as root)

---

## 🧪 How SOS Report Works (Step-by-Step)

1. Log into your Linux system.
2. Switch to root user.
3. Run the command: `sosreport`
4. It will:
   - Display the version (e.g., 3.5)
   - Inform you about data collection and file storage location (`/var/tmp`)
   - Prompt for:
     - **Name/initials**
     - **Case ID** (provided by Red Hat when you open a support ticket)
5. It starts collecting:
   - Configuration files (`/etc`)
   - Logs (`/var/log`)
   - System info (hardware, network, services, etc.)
6. Takes 1–5 minutes depending on system resources.

## 📁 Output File Details

- Location: `/var/tmp/`
- File Name Format: `sosreport-<hostname>-<date>-<caseID>.tar.xz`
- Additional file: `.md5` checksum (can be ignored unless needed for integrity check)

---

## 📤 How to Send to Red Hat

- Use FTP to upload the `.tar.xz` file to the Red Hat Customer Portal.
- If FTP is blocked, download the file to your local machine and upload it manually.
- Once received, Red Hat support analyzes the archive to diagnose the issue.

---

## ✅ Key Points to Remember

- Always run `sosreport` as **root**.
- You don’t need to manually gather logs—`sosreport` handles it for you.
- Used when creating a case with Red Hat or CentOS support.
- Helps minimize back-and-forth with support teams.

## 🎯 Practice Tip

Try running `sosreport` on a test CentOS or RHEL system. Explore the generated archive in `/var/tmp` to see what data gets included. It’s a great way to understand what your system reveals to support engineers.
