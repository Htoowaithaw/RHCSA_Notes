# 🖥️ Changing Linux System Hostname (Lecture Notes)

The **hostname** is the name assigned to a Linux machine during installation. It uniquely identifies the system on a network. Over time, if a system is repurposed or reused for a different role, administrators may need to change its hostname to reflect its new function or to follow organizational naming standards.

---

## 🧾 Command to Change Hostname

To change the hostname in modern Linux distributions (using `systemd`), the following command is used:

- `hostnamectl set-hostname <new-hostname>`

> ⚠️ No dash between "set" and "hostname"

---

## 🗂️ Hostname Configuration Files

- **Linux 7 and newer**:
  - `/etc/hostname` — stores the current hostname
- **Linux 6 and older**:
  - `/etc/sysconfig/network` — older method of storing hostname settings

You can either:
- Modify the file directly, or
- Use the `hostnamectl` command, which updates the file automatically

---

## 👨‍💻 Demonstration Recap

- Current hostname was displayed using the `hostname` command.
- File `/etc/hostname` was viewed using `cat` to confirm the stored name.
- Hostname was changed to `NYCHost1` using `hostnamectl set-hostname NYCHost1`.
- Confirmed the new name was saved in `/etc/hostname`.
- The `hostname` command showed the updated name.
- However, the terminal prompt still displayed the **old** hostname because the shell session had not been restarted.

---

## 🔄 Applying the Change

To fully apply and reflect the new hostname in the shell prompt:

- Either restart the shell session, or
- **Reboot the system** using one of the following:
  - `reboot`
  - `init 6` (legacy command)

After reboot, the terminal prompt displayed the new hostname successfully.

---

## 🧪 Reverting the Hostname

- To change the hostname back:
  - Edited `/etc/hostname` file directly and restored the original name.
  - Rebooted the system again for the change to take effect.

---

## 🪟 Bonus: Windows Hostname Change (GUI)

- Go to **My Computer** → Right-click → **Properties** → **Change settings**
- Hostname can be changed from the system properties window.
- Simple graphical interface, no command line needed.

---

## ✅ Important Reminders

- You must be **root** to change the hostname.
- Changes made using `hostnamectl` take effect immediately, but may not reflect in the current shell until reboot.
- Manual file edits require a system restart to apply.
- Always verify hostname changes using:
  - `hostname` (current active name)
  - `cat /etc/hostname` (stored name)

---

## 🎯 Practice Tip

Try both methods of hostname change:
1. Using `hostnamectl`
2. Editing `/etc/hostname` manually  
Then reboot and observe the effect.
