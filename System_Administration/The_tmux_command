🧱 TMUX - Terminal Multiplexer in Linux
📚 What is TMUX?

    TMUX stands for Terminal MUltipleXer.

    It is a modern replacement for the outdated screen utility.

    Useful in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 and CentOS 8, where screen is no longer available.

    Allows multiple terminal sessions inside a single window.

    You can split the screen, run commands in parallel, detach from a session and reattach later without losing your work.

    Especially useful for remote server management and multitasking.

📜 History of TMUX

    2007: Created by Nicholas Marriott to improve upon limitations of screen.

    2009: TMUX version 1.0 released with window splitting and better customization.

    2019: TMUX 3.0 added plugin support and improved external control.

    Now: TMUX is widely adopted in modern Linux distributions, including RHEL and CentOS.

🚀 Installation (on RHEL/CentOS)

    Use the command dnf install tmux -y to install without confirmation prompts.

    You can verify the installation with rpm -qa | grep tmux.

▶️ Starting a TMUX Session

    Run the tmux command to begin a new session.

    A bottom bar will appear showing:

        Session number, like [0]

        Window name, such as bash

        Hostname and system time

🔀 TMUX Keyboard Shortcuts

TMUX shortcuts always start with Ctrl + B, followed by another key.

    Split screen vertically: Ctrl + B, then %

    Split screen horizontally: Ctrl + B, then "

    Navigate between panes: Ctrl + B, then arrow keys

    Create a new window: Ctrl + B, then C

    Switch to next window: Ctrl + B, then N

    Rename current window: Ctrl + B, then ,

    Close current pane/window: Ctrl + D

    Detach from session: Ctrl + B, then D

🧪 Using TMUX in Practice

    Start TMUX: type tmux

    Split terminal vertically: Ctrl + B, %

    Split terminal horizontally: Ctrl + B, "

    Move between panes: use arrow keys with Ctrl + B

    Run long commands in one pane like ping google.com

    You will see window renamed temporarily from bash to ping

📛 Creating and Naming Sessions

    Create a named session: tmux new -s imran

    Now instead of session [0], your session name is 'imran'

➕ Working with Windows

    Create additional windows: Ctrl + B, then C

    Cycle through windows: Ctrl + B, then N

    Close any window: Ctrl + D (only closes that window, not entire session)

    Rename current window: Ctrl + B, then ,

🧷 Detaching and Reattaching Sessions

    Detach: Ctrl + B, then D (session continues running in background)

    View active sessions: tmux ls

    Reattach to session: tmux a or tmux attach -t session_name

🧹 Killing Sessions

    Kill session by ID: tmux kill-session -t 0

    Kill named session: tmux kill-session -t imran

    After killing, run tmux ls to verify all sessions are terminated

🔚 Summary

    TMUX is a powerful terminal multiplexer used to manage multiple terminal sessions efficiently.

    Replaces the older screen command with a better interface and features.

    Allows multitasking, session persistence, and flexible terminal layout.

    Great for developers, sysadmins, and anyone working in the Linux CLI regularly.

✅ Practice Suggestions
