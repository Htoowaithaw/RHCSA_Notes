# üñ•Ô∏è Finding System Information (Lecture Notes)

Every time you log into a Linux machine, it's important to verify what system you're on ‚Äî including the OS version, kernel, hardware specs, and hostname.

## üìå Key Commands

### `cat /etc/redhat-release`
- Shows the OS version (e.g., CentOS 7.4, update 1708).
- Reads a simple text file containing release info.

### `uname -a`
- Displays system information:
  - Kernel name and version
  - Architecture (e.g., x86_64)
  - Hostname
  - OS build date and time

### `dmidecode`
- Shows detailed hardware info (BIOS, CPU, RAM, manufacturer).
- Requires root privileges.
- To read it page by page:  
  Use `dmidecode | more`

## üß† Extra Tip

- Always run `hostname` after login to verify which machine you're on.
- This helps prevent accidents like rebooting the wrong system.

## ‚úÖ Practice Tip

As soon as you log in:
1. Run `uname -a` to check OS and kernel.
2. Run `hostname` to confirm the machine.
3. Use `cat /etc/redhat-release` for distro version.
4. Use `dmidecode` as root for hardware specs.
