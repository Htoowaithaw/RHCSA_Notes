# üìä Real-Time Process Monitoring with `top` in Linux

## üéØ Purpose
The `top` command provides a real-time, dynamic view of all processes and system performance in a Linux environment. It is one of the most frequently used tools by system administrators and engineers for monitoring, diagnosing, and managing system resource usage.

---

## üß© What is the `top` Command?

- Displays a **live**, continuously updating summary of system activity.
- Shows **CPU**, **memory**, **swap**, **load average**, and **process-level** details.
- Enters an **interactive mode** where additional keys can be pressed for real-time actions.
- Used to identify high-resource processes and optionally terminate them directly.

## üîß Interactive Commands Within `top`

While `top` is running, you can press the following keys to perform actions:

| Key | Action                                                                 |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Q   | Quit `top` and return to terminal                                     |
| C   | Toggle full command path display                                     |
| K   | Kill a process by entering its PID                                   |
| M   | Sort processes by memory usage (high to low)                         |
| P   | Sort processes by CPU usage (high to low)                            |

You can change the **refresh interval** (default: 3 seconds) by pressing `d` or using the configuration options.

---

## üéØ Filtering by User

You can limit the output of `top` to show processes for a specific user:

- Use the `-u` option followed by the username
- This filters the display to only show that user's processes

Example behavior:
- `top -u iafzal` shows all tasks owned by user `iafzal`
- `top -u root` shows all tasks owned by `root`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Tips for System Administrators

- Use `top` to troubleshoot performance issues in real time.
- Identify high CPU or memory consuming processes.
- Kill processes directly from within `top` using the `K` key and process ID.
- Sort data to prioritize high-impact processes using `M` (memory) and `P` (CPU).
- Quickly locate slow or stuck processes and investigate them interactively.

---

## üß† Practical Notes

- Top refreshes automatically every 3 seconds by default.
- It runs in **interactive mode**, and the terminal prompt will disappear while it‚Äôs active.
- You must press `Q` to quit and return to the shell prompt.
- `top` is non-root by default, but certain actions like killing root-owned processes require root privileges.
