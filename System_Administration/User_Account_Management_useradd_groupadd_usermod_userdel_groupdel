# 🧑‍💻 Linux User Account Management – Complete Guide

This note covers the essentials of **Linux user and group management**, based on the lesson provided. It also includes **extra details and practical examples** that are important to fully understand this topic.

## ✨ Why User and Group Management Matters
Linux is a **multi-user OS**. Different users can log in at the same time, access files, and run commands. To control **who can do what**, Linux uses:
- **Users**: Individual accounts.
- **Groups**: A collection of users with shared permissions.
- **Others**: Anyone not part of the user or group.

## 🔑 Key Commands for User & Group Management

### **1. Create a New User**
```bash
sudo useradd <username>

    Creates a new user account.

    By default, it also creates a private group with the same name as the user.

Example:

sudo useradd spiderman

2. Create a New Group

sudo groupadd <groupname>

Example:

sudo groupadd superheroes

3. Delete a User

sudo userdel <username>

    Removes the user but keeps the home directory.

To delete the user and their home directory:

sudo userdel -r <username>

Example:

sudo userdel -r spiderman

4. Delete a Group

sudo groupdel <groupname>

Example:

sudo groupdel superheroes

5. Modify a User (usermod)

sudo usermod [options] <username>

Common Options:

    -G <group> → Add user to a supplementary group.

    -g <group> → Change the primary group.

    -d <new_home> → Change the home directory.

    -s <shell> → Change the default shell.

    -c <comment> → Add a description for the user.

Example: Add spiderman to the superheroes group:

sudo usermod -G superheroes spiderman

6. Set or Change a Password

sudo passwd <username>

Example:

sudo passwd ironman

7. Verify User Information

id <username>

Shows the user’s UID (User ID), GID (Group ID), and groups.

Example:

id spiderman

8. Check Group Information

groups <username>

OR search inside /etc/group:

grep spiderman /etc/group

📂 Key Files for User & Group Information
1. /etc/passwd

    Stores basic user info.

    Format:

username:x:UID:GID:description:home_directory:shell

Example line:

    spiderman:x:1001:1001:Peter Parker:/home/spiderman:/bin/bash

2. /etc/group

    Stores group info.

    Format:

group_name:x:GID:member1,member2

Example line:

    superheroes:x:1002:spiderman,ironman

3. /etc/shadow

    Stores encrypted passwords and password policies.

    Accessible only by root.

    Format (simplified):

    username:encrypted_password:last_change:min:max:warn:inactive:expire

🏗 Real-Life Example Command

Create ironman in superheroes group with a custom home directory and description:

sudo useradd -G superheroes -s /bin/bash -c "Iron Man Character" -m -d /home/ironman ironman
sudo passwd ironman

    -G superheroes → Adds to group superheroes.

    -s /bin/bash → Assigns bash shell.

    -c "Iron Man Character" → Adds description.

    -m → Creates home directory if missing.

    -d /home/ironman → Sets home directory path.

🧠 Additional Knowledge You Should Know
1. UID and GID

    UID (User ID): A unique number for every user.

    GID (Group ID): A unique number for every group.

    Standard users usually start from UID 1000 on most distros.

    Root always has UID = 0.

2. Primary vs Supplementary Group

    Primary group: The default group a user belongs to (usually same as username).

    Supplementary groups: Extra groups for additional permissions.

3. Default User Files

When a user is created, default files are copied from /etc/skel into their home directory. You can add files there to automatically include them for all new users.
4. Locking or Unlocking Users

    Lock a user (disable login):

sudo usermod -L <username>

Unlock a user:

    sudo usermod -U <username>

5. Changing User Ownership of Files

    If you add a user to a new group but want files to reflect it:

    sudo chgrp -R superheroes /home/spiderman

    (-R applies recursively)

6. Viewing and Switching Users

    Check who you are:

whoami

Switch user:

    su - <username>

📝 Summary

    useradd, userdel, usermod: Manage users.

    groupadd, groupdel: Manage groups.

    passwd: Set passwords.

    /etc/passwd, /etc/group, /etc/shadow: Key files for account info.

    Always run these commands as root or with sudo.
