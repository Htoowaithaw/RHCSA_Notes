ðŸ“Š System Monitoring in Linux
=============================

âœ… Overview:
System monitoring is a critical responsibility for system administrators and engineers. These commands help you check CPU, memory, disk, network, and system health to ensure your Linux environment is running efficiently.

ðŸ§  Must-Know Monitoring Commands:

1. **top**
   - Displays real-time information about CPU and memory usage.
   - Shows running processes, their owners, and resource consumption.
   - Use this to quickly identify processes using high CPU or memory.

2. **df**
   - Reports disk space usage per filesystem.
   - Use the human-readable option to make output easier to understand.
   - Check for 100% disk usage to troubleshoot unresponsive systems.

3. **du**
   - Summarizes file and directory space usage.
   - Useful for identifying which files or folders consume the most disk space.

4. **dmesg**
   - Shows boot and kernel messages.
   - Helps identify hardware errors, system initialization logs, or failures.
   - Pipe output through a pager to view one screen at a time.

5. **iostat**
   - Displays input/output statistics for devices and CPU.
   - Helps monitor disk read/write activity.
   - Can be run with an interval to continuously monitor I/O performance.

6. **ip**
   - Replaces older networking tools like netstat.
   - Used to show IP address, routes, and interface details.
   - Commonly used option shows default gateway and device routing.

7. **ss**
   - Replaces netstat for listing socket connections.
   - Provides state, local/peer addresses, ports, and associated processes.
   - Useful for network diagnostics and connection monitoring.

8. **free**
   - Shows total, used, and free memory (RAM and swap).
   - Use it to assess memory usage and identify potential memory pressure.

9. **cat /proc/cpuinfo**
   - Displays detailed information about the CPU(s).
   - Includes model, cores, speed, and architecture details.

10. **cat /proc/meminfo**
    - Provides detailed memory usage, buffers, caches, and more.
    - Useful for low-level memory analysis beyond the free command.

ðŸ“Œ Notes:

- If disk usage reaches 100%, the system may become unresponsive.
- `/proc` is a virtual directory containing runtime system information.
- `/dev/null` can be used to discard unwanted command output.
- While it's not necessary to memorize every option, you should know when and why to use each command.
- Use `man` pages or online documentation to explore more options when needed.

ðŸŽ¯ Interview Tip:
If asked how you monitor system performance in an interview, confidently mention these tools and briefly explain what each is used for. This demonstrates strong foundational knowledge of system administration.
