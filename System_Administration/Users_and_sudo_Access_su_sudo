# 👥 Linux User Switching & Sudo Privileges (`su`, `sudo`, `visudo`, `wheel` group)

This note explains how to **switch between users**, grant **root-level permissions** using `sudo`, and manage **sudo access** securely via the `visudo` command and `wheel` group.

---

## 🔁 1. Switching Between Users (`su`)

### 📌 `su` (Switch User) Command

```bash
su - <username>

    Switches to the specified user.

    Prompts for that user’s password.

📌 Switch to Root User

su -

    Switches to the root account.

    Requires root password.

📌 Notes

    If you’re already root, switching to any user does not require their password.

    Use exit to return to your previous user session.

⚙️ 2. Running Root Commands Without Root (sudo)
📌 What is sudo?

    Allows a regular user to execute privileged (root-only) commands.

    Safer alternative to giving full root access.

📌 Basic Usage

sudo <command>

Examples:

sudo dmidecode
sudo fdisk -l

If you run them without sudo:

dmidecode
fdisk -l

You will get:

Permission denied

🛡 3. Managing Sudo Access with visudo
📌 What is visudo?

    Safely edits the sudo configuration file: /etc/sudoers

    Prevents saving incorrect syntax that could lock you out of sudo access

📌 Run with:

sudo visudo

    Opens file in vi or nano (based on system config)

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 4. Granting Sudo Access to Users (via wheel Group)
📌 What is wheel?

    A special group pre-configured in many Linux distros to allow sudo access

    Already defined in /etc/sudoers

%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL

✅ Steps to Grant Sudo Access to a User:

    Add user to wheel group:

sudo usermod -G wheel <username>

    Verify membership:

grep wheel /etc/group

    Test with a sudo command:

su - <username>
sudo dmidecode

    Will prompt for the user’s password the first time.

    If accepted, the user now has sudo privileges.

🛑 Optional: Grant Sudo Access to Specific User in /etc/sudoers

If not using wheel group, you can add a specific line for a user:

username  ALL=(ALL)  ALL

Example:

iafzal  ALL=(ALL)  ALL

    ⚠️ Only use this method if you're not using group-based sudo control.

📝 Summary Table
Command	Purpose
su - <user>	Switch to another user (needs their password)
su -	Switch to root (needs root password)
sudo <cmd>	Run a command with root privileges
visudo	Safely edit /etc/sudoers file
usermod -G wheel <user>	Add user to wheel group for sudo access
grep wheel /etc/group	Confirm user is in wheel group
✅ Example Flow: Giving Sudo Access

# Become root
su -

# Add user to wheel group
usermod -G wheel ironman

# Confirm
grep wheel /etc/group

# Switch back and test
su - ironman
sudo fdisk -l

👮 Bonus: Security Best Practices

    Prefer group-based sudo (wheel) instead of editing sudoers for each user.

    Use sudo for auditing — logs go to /var/log/secure or /var/log/auth.log.

    Avoid logging in as root unless absolutely necessary.
