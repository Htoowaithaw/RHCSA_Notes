# üßë‚Äçüíª Linux User Monitoring Commands ‚Äì Who‚Äôs Logged In & What They‚Äôre Doing

This note explains how to **monitor logged-in users, user activity, and login history** on a Linux system. These are essential tasks for any system administrator to **audit user behavior**, **troubleshoot high load**, or **track unauthorized access**.

---

## üß© Why User Monitoring Is Important

- Know **who is logged in**
- See **when and from where** users logged in
- Check **what commands** users are running
- Track **reboots, shutdowns, and suspicious activity**

## üîç Basic User Monitoring Commands

### ‚úÖ `who`

```bash
who

    Shows currently logged-in users.

    Includes:

        Username

        Terminal (tty/pts)

        Login time

Example Output:

spiderman  pts/0  Jul 25 14:12
ironman    pts/1  Jul 25 14:33

    Useful during high load to check how many sessions are active.

‚úÖ last

last

    Displays login history (stored in /var/log/wtmp).

    Includes:

        Username

        IP address (if remote)

        Login + logout times

        System reboots

Example:

last | more

    Pipe through more to scroll one page at a time.

Show just usernames (no duplicates):

last | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq

‚úÖ w

w

    Like who but more detailed.

    Includes:

        Username

        Login time

        Idle time

        Terminal

        Current command/process

Example Output:

USER     TTY      FROM             IDLE   WHAT
spiderman pts/0   192.168.56.101   00:10  vim notes.txt

‚úÖ id

id [username]

    Shows UID, GID, and group memberships.

    Useful for checking a user‚Äôs identity or group access.

Examples:

id           # Shows info for current user
id spiderman # Shows info for another user

‚ö†Ô∏è finger (Optional)

finger <user>

    Gives full user info: login name, home directory, shell, etc.

    Not installed by default. Install with:

sudo yum install finger   # RHEL/CentOS
sudo apt install finger   # Ubuntu/Debian

    Often used for tracing user origin and session protocol.

üß† Practice Tips

    Open multiple terminals or PuTTY sessions to simulate multiple users.

    Run:

who
w
last

    Observe how they update as users log in/out.

    Check IPs and login timestamps.

üìñ Use man for Options

To explore more:

man who
man last
man w

Try options like:

    who -a ‚Üí Show all details including dead processes and run-level info.

    last -x ‚Üí Show reboots, shutdowns, and runlevel changes.
