# 🗂️ Linux File Permissions and Ownership

## 📌 Overview
In Linux, **file permissions** and **ownership** help secure the system by controlling **who can read, write, or execute** files and directories.  
Linux is a **multi-user system**, so every file and directory has:
- **Owner (User)** → The creator of the file.
- **Group** → Users in the same group/project/department.
- **Others** → Everyone else.

## 🔑 Types of Permissions
| Permission | Symbol | Meaning |
|------------|--------|---------|
| **Read**   | `r` | View contents of a file or list a directory. |
| **Write**  | `w` | Modify or delete the file or its contents. |
| **Execute**| `x` | Run a program or script; enter a directory. |

---

## 👥 Permission Levels
Permissions are divided into three **sets of three characters**:

Example:
 
-rw-rw-r--
 
- **First character** → Type of file (`-` for file, `d` for directory, `l` for link).
- **Next 3 characters** → Permissions for **User (Owner)**.
- **Next 3 characters** → Permissions for **Group**.
- **Last 3 characters** → Permissions for **Others**.

| Character | Represents |
|------------|------------|
| `u` | User (Owner) |
| `g` | Group |
| `o` | Others |
| `a` | All (u + g + o) |

---

## 📂 Viewing Permissions
 
ls -l
 

Example output:
 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 iafzal iafzal  4096 Sep 11 09:00 Jerry
 
- `-rw-rw-r--` → Permission string.
- First `rw-` → Owner can read & write.
- Second `rw-` → Group can read & write.
- Last `r--` → Others can **only read**.

---

## 🛠️ Changing Permissions: `chmod`

### Syntax
 
chmod [ugoa][+-=][rwx] filename
 
| Symbol | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `+` | Add permission |
| `-` | Remove permission |
| `=` | Set exact permission |

### Examples
 
# Remove write permission from group
chmod g-w Jerry

# Remove read permission from everyone
chmod a-r Jerry

# Add read and write permission for user
chmod u+rw Jerry
 

Verify changes:
 
ls -l Jerry
 

---

## 🗂️ Directories and Execute Permission
- **Directories require `x` (execute) permission** to allow `cd` into them.
- If `x` is missing → `Permission denied` error.

Example:
 
chmod a-x myfolder  # Remove execute for all
chmod a+x myfolder  # Add execute back
 

---

## 👑 File Ownership

### Two Types of Ownership
1. **User (Owner)** → The creator of the file.
2. **Group** → Group to which the file belongs.

View ownership:
 
ls -l
 
Example:
 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep 11 09:00 Lisa
 

### Change File Owner
 
sudo chown newowner filename
 
Example:
 
sudo chown root Lisa
 

### Change File Group
 
sudo chgrp newgroup filename
 

### Change Both Owner and Group
 
sudo chown newowner:newgroup filename
 

---

## 🔁 Recursive Changes
To apply changes to a directory **and all files/subdirectories** inside:
 
sudo chown -R root:root /myfolder
sudo chmod -R 755 /myfolder
 

---

## 🧪 Practice Ideas
1. Create a test file:
    
   touch permission_test.txt
    
2. Experiment with:
   - `chmod`
   - `chown`
   - `chgrp`
3. Always test inside **your home directory** to avoid breaking system files.

---

## 🔐 Summary
- `r` = Read, `w` = Write, `x` = Execute
- Levels: **User (u), Group (g), Others (o)**
- Commands:
  - `chmod` → Change permissions
  - `chown` → Change file owner
  - `chgrp` → Change file group
- Always verify using:
   
  ls -l
