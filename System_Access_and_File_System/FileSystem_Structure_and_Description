# üìÅ Linux Filesystem Overview ‚Äì Explained Like a Closet

## üß† What is a Filesystem?

A **filesystem** is the structure used by an operating system to manage how files and directories are:
- Stored
- Organized
- Retrieved

> Think of it like organizing a **closet**:  
> - Shirts in one section  
> - Shoes in another  
> - Accessories, pants, jackets, etc., each in their own place  

If you throw everything into one pile (like one giant unorganized folder), it becomes a **mess** ‚Äî hard to find anything. The **filesystem prevents this chaos** by organizing data in a logical hierarchy.

## üñ•Ô∏è Filesystems by OS Type

| OS Type | Filesystems Used         |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Linux   | `ext3`, `ext4`, `xfs`     |
| Windows | `NTFS`, `FAT32`, `exFAT`  |

# üìÇ Filesystem Hierarchy in Linux (Directory Breakdown)

Linux uses a structured tree starting from the **root directory `/`**.

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `/`       | Root of the entire Linux filesystem (not the same as `/root`) |
| `/boot`   | Contains bootloader files like `grub.cfg` used to boot the system |
| `/root`   | Home directory for the **root user** |
| `/home`   | Home directories for all normal users (e.g., `/home/john`) |
| `/etc`    | **Configuration files** for system and applications |
| `/bin`    | Essential user commands (e.g., `ls`, `pwd`) ‚Äî now often symlinked to `/usr/bin` |
| `/sbin`   | System admin commands (e.g., filesystem tools) ‚Äî also symlinked to `/usr/sbin` |
| `/usr`    | Secondary hierarchy for user applications, binaries, libraries |
| `/opt`    | Optional 3rd-party applications (e.g., Oracle, SAP) |
| `/lib`    | Libraries for binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin` ‚Äî symlinked to `/usr/lib` |
| `/proc`   | Virtual filesystem with info about **running processes** and **kernel** ‚Äî disappears on shutdown |
| `/var`    | Variable data ‚Äî **log files**, mail, spool files go here |
| `/tmp`    | Temporary files, wiped on reboot |
| `/run`    | Runtime data for processes, PID files ‚Äî cleared at shutdown |
| `/mnt`    | Temporary mount point for manual mounts (e.g., USB, NFS) |
| `/media`  | Auto-mount location for CD-ROMs, USBs when inserted |

## üîß Key File Examples

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg` | Tells the system which OS/version to boot |
| `/etc/passwd` | Contains user account info |
| `/etc/fstab` | Static mount configuration |
| `/var/log/messages` | General system log |
| `/home/username/` | User's personal files and config |

# üõ†Ô∏è Tips for Managing Linux Filesystem

- Always back up files in `/etc` before making config changes.
- Files in `/proc` and `/run` are **temporary** ‚Äî created and managed by the kernel.
- `/opt` is ideal for 3rd-party app installations ‚Äî don‚Äôt mix with system apps.
- Use `ls -l` and `cd /` to explore directory structure.
- Use `strace -e open <command>` to check which libraries are used by a command.

üóÇÔ∏è Directory Behavior on Shutdown
| Directory | Emptied on Shutdown? |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| `/proc`   | ‚úÖ Yes                |
| `/run`    | ‚úÖ Yes                |
| `/tmp`    | ‚úÖ Often              |
| Others    | ‚ùå No                 |
