# 🌐 Traceroute Command in Linux  

## 📖 What is Traceroute?
- **Traceroute** is a network diagnostic tool used to **trace the journey of packets** from a source machine to a destination (IP, hostname, or URL).  
- It helps identify:  
  - **Where packets travel** (all hops/routers along the path).  
  - **Where issues occur** (data loss or delays).  
  - **Slow points in the network** affecting performance.  

- Equivalent commands:  
  - **Windows** → `tracert`  
  - **Linux/Unix** → `traceroute`  
  - **Mac** → `traceroute` (same as Linux)

## 🛠️ Why Use Traceroute?
- Detects **where traffic is being dropped**.  
- Identifies **faulty routers/servers** causing delays.  
- Helps troubleshoot **DNS resolution** and **gateway routing issues**.  

---

## 🔑 How It Works
- Each step (hop) = a router or gateway between source and destination.  
- Displays:  
  - Hop number (1, 2, 3, …).  
  - Device IP/hostname.  
  - Time (ms) for response per hop.  
- First hop is usually your **default gateway (modem/router)**.

## 💻 Basic Syntax
```bash
traceroute <hostname_or_IP>

Examples:

traceroute google.com
traceroute 8.8.8.8

📝 Example Walkthrough

    ping google.com → check connectivity first.

    Run:

    traceroute google.com

    Output shows hops:

        1st hop → Local gateway (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

        2nd hop → ISP NAT gateway / external IP.

        Next hops → Internet backbone routers.

        Final hop → Destination server (Google IP).

If any hop shows * * * or very high time → possible issue at that hop.
📌 Related Command

Check your default gateway:

netstat -rnv

Output shows:

    0.0.0.0 or default → your gateway IP (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

⚡ Key Takeaways

    Traceroute maps the path packets take.

    Useful for troubleshooting network issues (latency, packet loss, misconfigured gateway).

    Works best when DNS resolution is successful — otherwise, use IP directly.

    Combined with ping, it’s one of the most important Linux network troubleshooting tools.

✅ Practice:

    Run traceroute google.com from your Linux VM.

    Compare hops from home Wi-Fi vs office network.

    Identify which hop belongs to your router vs ISP.
