# Network files and commands — notes

Purpose:
bring a Linux system online, detect a network interface,
assign an IP address, and enable host-to-host
communication. Know the core config files and the basic
commands used to verify and troubleshoot.

Files to know:

- /etc/nsswitch.conf  
  Tells the system where to resolve names. Lines starting
  with “#” are comments. Typical order for hosts lookups:
  “files dns” (check /etc/hosts first, then DNS). Swap to
  “dns files” if you want DNS first. Also points passwd,
  shadow, and group lookups to local files.

- /etc/hosts  
  Local static name mapping. Add your IP and hostname
  (example idea: “192.168.1.14 myfirstlinuxos”). After
  that, “ping myfirstlinuxos” resolves locally. Think of
  it as a tiny DNS on your machine.

- /etc/sysconfig/network  
  Can hold the hostname and some global network settings.
  It might be empty if hostname was hardcoded elsewhere,
  but you can still change it here if needed.

- /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface>  
  Per-interface config (example: ifcfg-enp0s3). The name
  matches what you see in “ifconfig” or “ip a”. Common:
  “BOOTPROTO=dhcp” for dynamic IP, or change to “static”
  and define IPADDR, NETMASK, GATEWAY. This makes your IP
  persistent across reboots.

- /etc/resolv.conf  
  DNS resolver configuration. Define “nameserver” entries.
  When you visit something like “www.google.com”, the
  system asks the DNS server listed here to translate the
  name to an IP address.

Commands to remember:

- ping <host>  
  Test reachability (e.g., an external site like
  “www.hotmail.com”).

- ifconfig / ip a  
  Show interfaces and their IP addresses. Loopback is not
  counted as a real external interface; focus on your main
  device (e.g., enp0s3).

- ifdown <iface> / ifup <iface>  
  Bring an interface down or up when you need to disable or
  re-enable networking on that device.

- netstat (e.g., options r, b)  
  View routing and see how traffic flows, including
  gateways and which interface is used.

- tcpdump -i <iface>  
  Packet sniffer. Shows traffic entering and leaving the
  interface you specify.

Key reminders:

- All of these files exist on standard Linux systems; you
  will see them often in system administration.
- Memorize where they live, what they do, and how to read
  them. These are common interview topics.
- Use “man” pages (e.g., “man ping”, “man tcpdump”) to
  learn options and deepen familiarity.
