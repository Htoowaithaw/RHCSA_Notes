# üìí OpenLDAP Installation & Basics Note

## üè∑Ô∏è What is OpenLDAP?
- **OpenLDAP** = Open-source implementation of **LDAP** (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).  
- Developed by the **OpenLDAP Project** (community-driven, free alternative to Microsoft AD).  
- Protocol mainly used by **email, authentication, and access services** to look up user/contact information.  
- Licensed under **OpenLDAP Public License**.  
- Supported on: Linux, AIX, Android, HP-UX, macOS, Solaris, and even Windows.  
- Popular in Linux environments with **thousands of users** that need centralized authentication across servers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Service & Management
- OpenLDAP runs as the **`slapd`** service.
- Commands:
  ```bash
  systemctl start slapd      # Start service
  systemctl stop slapd       # Stop service
  systemctl restart slapd    # Restart service
  systemctl enable slapd     # Enable on boot
  systemctl status slapd     # Check status

üìÇ Configuration Files

    Main config directory:

/etc/openldap/slapd.d

Client authentication config:

/etc/nsswitch.conf

    Example line (default):

passwd: files

Change to include LDAP:

        passwd: files ldap

        This means:

            First check local /etc/passwd

            If not found ‚Üí check LDAP server

üì• Installation

    Verify internet access:

ping google.com

‚úÖ If ICMP replies ‚Üí you can reach internet.

Install OpenLDAP:

yum install *openldap*

    The * ensures all packages with "openldap" in their name are installed.

    Installs server + client utilities.

Verify installation:

    Check service:

systemctl status slapd

Verify process:

        ps -ef | grep slapd

üîë Authentication Flow

    Local authentication:

        Checks /etc/passwd file for users.

    LDAP authentication:

        If user not found locally, system queries LDAP server.

    Typical environment:

        Dedicated LDAP server (on separate Linux machine).

        Other client machines configured to authenticate against it.

üõ†Ô∏è Notes

    OpenLDAP Server = central directory service (like free Active Directory).

    Clients = authenticate users by querying the LDAP server.

    Configuration is complex (schemas, domains, replication, access rules). Full setup may take hours.

    For practice: installation + service management is enough for RHCSA-level exposure.

‚úÖ Summary

    OpenLDAP provides centralized authentication similar to Active Directory.

    Install with yum install *openldap*.

    Managed by slapd service.

    Configs in /etc/openldap/slapd.d.

    Authentication order set in /etc/nsswitch.conf.

    Commonly used in enterprises with large user bases across multiple servers.
