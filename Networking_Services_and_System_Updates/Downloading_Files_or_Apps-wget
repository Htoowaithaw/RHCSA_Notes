# 🌐 wget – Download Files from the Web in Linux

## 📖 What is wget?
- **Definition**: Command-line tool in Linux for downloading files from the internet using a given URL.
- **Name meaning**:  
  - **W** → World Wide Web  
  - **get** → retrieve a file
- **Usage**: Ideal when a package is not available in your default repositories and must be fetched from a third-party source.

---

## 🖥️ Why use wget instead of `yum`?
- Normally, `yum install <package>` downloads from configured repositories (mirrors).
- If the package **does not exist** in those repositories, yum will fail with:

No package <name> available

- Some packages are hosted only on **third-party vendor websites**.
- **Solution**: Use `wget` to directly download the file from its full URL.

---

## ⚙️ wget Syntax
```sh
wget <full_file_URL>

    <full_file_URL>: Must be the complete direct download link (ending with .tar, .zip, .rpm, .msi, etc.).

🛠️ Example Scenario – Download PuTTY Source for Linux
1️⃣ Attempt install via yum (fails)

sudo yum install putty
# Result: No package putty available

2️⃣ Find direct download link

    Search online (e.g., “Download PuTTY”).

    Locate the Unix source archive link.

    Right-click → Copy Link Location.

Example URL:

https://the.official.site/path/to/putty-0.x.y.tar.gz

3️⃣ Download using wget

wget https://the.official.site/path/to/putty-0.x.y.tar.gz

    Connects to server and downloads file.

    Output shows progress, size, and speed.

4️⃣ Verify download

pwd          # Check current directory
ls -ltr      # Should see the downloaded file

Example:

putty-0.x.y.tar.gz
