# 📦 Linux System Updates & Repositories (CentOS/RHEL)

## 🗂️ Understanding Repositories (Repos)
- **Repos** = Repositories — storage locations for software packages.
- Contain URLs pointing to package sources (online mirrors or local servers).
- Config files stored in:  
  `/etc/yum.repos.d/`  
  → Used by both `yum` (old) and `dnf` (new).

## ⚙️ Package Management Commands

### 1️⃣ `dnf` (CentOS 8+, RHEL 8+)
- Replacement for `yum` (CentOS 7 or earlier still uses `yum`).
- Common in **CentOS/RHEL**; similar to `apt-get` in Debian/Ubuntu.
- Can:
  - Search for packages in configured repos.
  - Download and install packages (plus dependencies).
  - Remove packages.
- Needs **internet access** unless using a local repo.
- Syntax:
  ```bash
  dnf install <package>
  dnf remove <package>

    Example:

    dnf install chrony    # Installs NTP replacement
    dnf install httpd     # Installs Apache

2️⃣ rpm (Red Hat Package Manager)

    Older tool, still supported.

    Works with already downloaded .rpm files (local install).

    Does NOT auto-install dependencies (you must install them manually).

    Common in offline environments.

    Syntax:

    rpm -ihv /path/to/package.rpm   # Install
    rpm -e <package_name>           # Remove
    rpm -qa                         # List all installed packages
    rpm -qa | grep <keyword>        # Search installed packages

    Options:

        -i = install

        -h = show progress

        -v = verbose

        -e = erase (remove)

        -q = query

        -a = all

🔍 Checking Installed Packages

    List all:

rpm -qa

Count installed packages:

rpm -qa | wc -l

Search for a specific package:

    rpm -qa | grep bind

📥 Installing Packages – Example

dnf install bind

    dnf checks:

        If package exists locally.

        If not, goes to repos defined in /etc/yum.repos.d/.

    Downloads + installs + verifies + cleans up.

🗑️ Removing Packages

    With rpm:

rpm -e bind

With dnf:

    dnf remove bind

📝 Key Differences: dnf vs rpm
Feature	dnf	rpm
Downloads package?	✅ Yes	❌ No (local files only)
Installs deps?	✅ Yes (auto dependency resolution)	❌ No (manual install required)
Repo aware?	✅ Yes (online/local repos)	❌ No (works offline)
Cleans up files?	✅ Yes (saves space)	❌ No
💡 Tips

    Always check your hostname before installing packages to ensure you’re on the correct server:

    hostname

    dnf is smarter and more convenient for online systems.

    Use rpm mainly for offline or special package installs.

    Dependencies = extra packages required for the main package to work.
