# Chronyd – Modern Replacement for NTP Daemon

## Purpose
- Chronyd is a modern time synchronization daemon, replacing the older `ntpd`.
- Synchronizes system clock with external or internal NTP servers.
- Offers enhanced features over the traditional NTP service.

---

## Package & Configuration
- **Package name:** `chrony`
- **Configuration file:** `/etc/chrony.conf`
- **Log directory:** `/var/log/chrony/`
- **Main service:** `chronyd` (systemd managed)

---

## Workflow
1. **Check Installation**
   ```bash
   rpm -qa | grep chrony

    If not installed:

    sudo dnf install chrony -y

    Configure chrony.conf

        Open:

sudo vi /etc/chrony.conf

Define NTP servers:

    server pool.ntp.org iburst

    (Can temporarily test with 8.8.8.8 for demo, though it's a DNS server, not real NTP)

Avoid Running NTP & Chrony Together

sudo systemctl stop ntpd
sudo systemctl disable ntpd

Start & Enable Chronyd

    sudo systemctl start chronyd
    sudo systemctl enable chronyd
    sudo systemctl status chronyd

Monitoring & Commands

    Interactive tool: chronyc

    Common commands inside chronyc:

        help → list available commands

        sources → show connected NTP sources and sync status

        quit → exit

    Direct (non-interactive) usage:

    chronyc sources -v

Key Points

    Chronyd = new standard in RHEL/CentOS for time sync.

    Do not run ntpd and chronyd at the same time.

    Always restart the service after modifying /etc/chrony.conf:

    sudo systemctl restart chronyd
