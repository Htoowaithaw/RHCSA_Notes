# 🌐 Client-Server Relationship

## 📖 Concept Overview
- **Client** → The entity (computer or software) making a request.
- **Server** → The entity (computer or software) fulfilling the request.
- Both can be **physical machines** or **software programs** running on any operating system.
- Communication happens over a network (Internet or local) using specific protocols like **HTTP** or **TCP/IP**.

## 🍔 Real-Life Analogy (McDonald's Example)
- **You** order: "I would like a chicken sandwich, please." → **Client** (request maker)
- **McDonald's** replies: "Here is your sandwich, sir." → **Server** (request fulfiller)
- Servers can fulfill multiple types of requests (e.g., burgers, fries, shakes, cookies).
