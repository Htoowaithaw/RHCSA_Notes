## 2. Pre-Installation Check
- Ensure **network connectivity** before downloading packages.  
- Command:  
  ```bash
  ping www.google.com

    Example: Both RHEL 8 and CentOS 7 machines had internet connectivity confirmed.

3. Installation of Cockpit

    Check if Cockpit already installed:

rpm -qa | grep cockpit

On RHEL 8 â†’ Cockpit preinstalled.

On CentOS 7 â†’ Not installed, so:

    yum install cockpit -y

        -y automatically accepts dependency prompts.

Verification after install:

rpm -qa | grep cockpit

4. Start & Enable Cockpit Service

    Check service status:

systemctl status cockpit

Start service if inactive:

systemctl start cockpit

Enable on boot:

    systemctl enable cockpit (or) systemctl enable cockpit.socket 

5. Access Cockpit Web Interface

    Default port: 9090

    Access format:

https://<IP_of_server>:9090

Find IP:

ip a

If firewall blocks access:

    Option 1: Disable firewall (temporary)

        systemctl stop firewalld

        Option 2: Access via localhost browser on the server.

    First login shows certificate warning â†’ accept risk to proceed.

6. Cockpit Web UI Overview

    Dashboard/Home: System info, health status, CPU/memory usage, updates.

    Logs: View error, warning, critical, or info logs.

    Storage: Disk usage (similar to df -h), mount points, performance data.

    Networking: Manage interfaces, create bond/team/bridge/VLAN.

    Accounts: Add/remove users.

    Services: Manage system services (systemctl equivalent).

    Applications: Installed apps list, option to add/remove.

    Diagnostic Reports: Generate troubleshooting logs (like sosreport).

    Kernel Dump & SELinux: Configure crash dump & SELinux modes.

    Software Updates: Install available updates.

    Subscription: Manage Red Hat subscription info.

    Terminal: Built-in web terminal (like SSH/putty).

7. Differences Between RHEL 8 & CentOS 7

    RHEL 8: Cockpit preinstalled, more features (updates, subscriptions).

    CentOS 7: Needs manual installation, fewer integrated options.

8. Key Takeaways

    Cockpit simplifies server monitoring & management with a browser-based GUI.

    Useful for admins who prefer web access, but fully complements CLI usage.

    Port 9090 is essential for remote access.

    Works across RHEL 7/8, CentOS 7/8, Ubuntu, Fedora.



    (For some VM with NAT Port Forwarding Enabled)

From your host machine

run:
ssh -p 2223 -L 9090:127.0.0.1:9090 htoo@127.0.0.1 #2223 can be anything connected from your host to VM port 22 ssh port. In my case.it's 2223. 9090 is the default port for cockpit. -L flag make port forwarding from ssh to cockpit. So what this command basically do is, "If you log in successfully from your host port 2223 to VM ssh, that ssh tunnel will do port forwarding for cockpit for 9090. Then you can log in with cockpit from your host to VM by typing on browser

https://127.0.0.1:9090
