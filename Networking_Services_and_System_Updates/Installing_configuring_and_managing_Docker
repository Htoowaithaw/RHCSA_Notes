# 🐳 Docker on Linux – Notes

## 🚢 Container Recap
- Concept came from **shipping containers**:
  - Same size → fits anywhere (trucks, ships, warehouses).
  - Easy & consistent transport worldwide.
- **IT containers**:
  - Package = Application code + Libraries + Configs (⚠️ no OS).
  - Portable across systems → "runs on my computer" issue solved.
  - Multiple containers can run on one OS.

---

## 👩‍💻 Role of Containers
- **Developers** → build apps, package code inside containers.
- **Sysadmins** → install, configure & manage containers (not build them).

---

## 🐳 What is Docker?
- **Open platform** for developing, shipping, and running apps.
- Lets you separate **apps from infrastructure** → deliver software quickly.
- Provides:
  - **Docker Engine** → runs containers.
  - **Docker Hub** → registry (cloud fridge for images).
- Runs on **Linux & Windows**.

---

## 📦 Docker Components
- **Docker CE** (Community Edition – free, open-source).
- **Docker EE** (Enterprise Edition – paid, advanced features).
- **Docker Engine includes**:
  - `docker-ce` → Core engine.
  - `docker-ce-cli` → Command line client.
  - `containerd.io` → Runtime for containers.
  - `docker-buildx-plugin` → Advanced build features.
  - `docker-compose-plugin` → Multi-container apps.

---

## 🗓 Docker History
- **2010** → Started as internal project at dotCloud.
- **2013** → Released as open-source.
- **2015** → Introduced Docker Swarm (orchestration).
- **2020+** → Focus on Docker Desktop, Hub, cloud-native workflows.

---

## 🍱 Analogy
- Docker Image = **lunchbox** with food, utensils, napkins.
- Once packed → anyone can eat without extra prep.
- Docker Hub = **fridge** storing lunchboxes (images).

## ⚙️ Install Docker on CentOS (Steps)

### 1. Prerequisites
- Use latest CentOS Stream 9.
- Remove old Docker if present:
  ```bash
  rpm -qa | grep docker

2. Install yum-utils

dnf install -y yum-utils

3. Add Docker repo

dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

4. Install Docker Engine & Tools

dnf install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

5. Start & Enable Docker

systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker
systemctl status docker

6. Verify Version

docker --version

🚀 Test Docker

    Run hello world container:

    docker run hello-world

        Checks local image → if missing, pulls from Docker Hub.

        Runs container → prints "Hello from Docker!".

        Confirms Docker installed & working.

🛠 Next Steps (Practice)

    Run Ubuntu container:

docker run -it ubuntu bash

Try pulling other images from Docker Hub:

    docker search nginx
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx

✅ Key Takeaways

    Docker = tool to create & manage containers.

    Containers = lightweight, portable environments.

    Docker Hub = central place to store/share images.

    Install requires repo + packages → enable service with systemctl.

    First test: docker run hello-world.

🚀 With Docker, you can build → ship → run apps anywhere consistently.
