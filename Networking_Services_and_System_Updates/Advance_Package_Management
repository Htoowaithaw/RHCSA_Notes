# 📦 Advanced Package Management in CentOS/Red Hat

This lesson covers advanced package management using **DNF** and **RPM** in CentOS/RHEL. You'll learn how to install, upgrade, remove, query, and find configuration files or source information for packages.

---

## 🛠 Tools Covered
- **DNF** – Preferred modern package manager for CentOS/RHEL.
- **RPM** – Low-level Red Hat Package Manager.
- Focus is on CentOS/RHEL (not Ubuntu's `apt-get`).

---

## 📋 Topics Covered
1. Installing packages (via `dnf` and `rpm`).
2. Upgrading packages.
3. Deleting packages.
4. Viewing package details.
5. Identifying which package a command belongs to.
6. Listing package configuration files.

---

## 🌐 Checking Internet Connection
```sh
ping www.facebook.com
ip a

    Confirms system is online and has an IP address.

📥 Installing a Package (Preferred Method: DNF)

Example: KornShell (ksh)

# Check if package exists
rpm -qa | grep ksh

# Install from repo
dnf install ksh*

    Shows package name, architecture, dependencies, and size.

    y to confirm installation.

    Verify installation:

rpm -qa | grep ksh

❌ Removing a Package (DNF)

dnf remove ksh*
rpm -qa | grep ksh  # Verify removal

📦 Installing Without Internet (Using RPM)

    Download .rpm file from a machine with internet.

        Example site: package.org

        Find .rpm link → copy link.

    Transfer to target system (via FTP, SCP, etc.).

    Install:

# Using wget (if internet is available)
wget <package_url>

# Install with RPM
rpm -ivh ksh-<version>.rpm

    Options:

        i → install

        v → verbose

        h → hash progress

    Verify:

rpm -qa | grep ksh

ℹ Viewing Package Information

rpm -qi ksh

Displays:

    Name, version, release, architecture

    Install date, group

    Summary & description

🗑 Removing a Package (RPM)

# Find exact package name
rpm -qa | grep ksh

# Remove
rpm -e ksh-<full_package_name>

# Verify removal
rpm -qa | grep ksh

⚙ Listing Package Configuration Files

rpm -qc ksh

    Shows config file locations (usually in /etc/...).

    Helps locate specific config files without guessing paths.

🔍 Finding Package of a Command

    Find full path of command:

which ksh

    Identify package:

rpm -qf /usr/bin/ksh

    Works for any command.

    Example:

which pwd
rpm -qf /usr/bin/pwd   # Belongs to coreutils

💡 Key Takeaways

    DNF is preferred for installing/removing packages.

    RPM is used for manual .rpm file installs and low-level queries.

    You can identify a package from any installed command.

    Configuration files can be listed directly without searching manually.

    Removing core packages (like coreutils) will break basic commands — reinstall if removed.
