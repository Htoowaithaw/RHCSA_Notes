SSH and Telnet are two main Linux services for remote access.

    Telnet:

        Old, insecure protocol.

        Rarely used today except for troubleshooting network issues.

        Not installed by default (telnet command will show "command not found").

        Can be installed with:

        yum install telnet

    SSH:

        Secure, modern replacement for Telnet.

        Comes with two package types:

            Client → initiates connections.

            Server → accepts connections.

        Example: SSH into another server → your machine is the client, remote is the server.

        Reverse roles in other cases (e.g., NTP sync).

Basic SSH usage

ssh <ip-address>

    Can connect to the same system for multiple sessions.

    Use exit to return to the original session.

Checking sshd process

ps -ef | grep sshd
systemctl status sshd

    /usr/sbin/sshd is the process that listens for incoming SSH connections.

Controlling SSH access

    Stop SSH service:

systemctl stop sshd

    Blocks new SSH logins.

    Existing sessions remain active.

Start SSH service:

    systemctl start sshd

        Restores SSH access.

Example scenario

    Check IP:

    ip a

    e.g., 192.168.1.12

    Stop sshd → attempt to connect via PuTTY → “Connection refused”.

    Start sshd → connection works again.

Key point: Stopping/starting sshd is a quick way to block or allow remote SSH access for security control.
