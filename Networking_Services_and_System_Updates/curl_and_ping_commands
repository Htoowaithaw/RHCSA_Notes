🌐 Curl and Ping Commands in Linux
📌 Purpose

curl and ping are two basic but essential commands for troubleshooting network issues.
They help verify if a host, service, or webpage is reachable from your system.
🧠 Why They’re Important

    Scenario: A user says, “The server is down” or “I can’t access a website.”

    As a sysadmin, first step is to check connectivity yourself.

    If Linux has no GUI browser, curl and ping are quick command-line tools to check reachability.

🔍 Curl Overview

    Name meaning: c + URL → works with URLs.

    Purpose: Access and retrieve data from a URL.

    Use case:

        Check if a webpage is up (returns HTML source code).

        Download files when wget is not available.

    Examples:

        Check webpage status:

curl http://www.google.com

    If HTML source code appears, the page is reachable.

Download file:

        curl -O https://example.com/file.tar.gz

            Saves file in the current directory.

            -O = output to a file with the same name as on the server.

📡 Ping Overview

    Purpose: Check if a host is reachable at the network level.

    How it works:

        Sends ICMP echo requests to the target host.

        Displays reply times and packet loss.

    Examples:

        Ping by hostname:

ping www.google.com

    Resolves to IP and sends packets until stopped with Ctrl+C.

Ping by IP:

    ping 216.58.217.68

Windows difference:

    By default, Windows pings only 4 times.

    Use:

        ping -t www.google.com

        to ping continuously.

📂 Practical Use Cases

    Check server availability:

        ping → is the host up?

    Check webpage availability:

        curl → is the web service up?

    Download files without browser:

        curl -O → get files via direct link.

💡 Troubleshooting Tips

    If ping works but curl fails → host is reachable, but the web service may be down.

    If both fail → possible network issue or firewall blocking traffic.

    Combine with nslookup to verify DNS resolution:

    nslookup www.google.com

✅ Summary

    Ping → Checks network connectivity (host up/down).

    Curl → Checks service/webpage availability and can download files.

    Together, they are first-line tools in network troubleshooting.
