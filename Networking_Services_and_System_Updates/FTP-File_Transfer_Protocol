# 📂 FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – Linux Server & Client Setup

## 🌐 What is FTP?
- **Definition**: Standard network protocol for transferring files between a client and a server over a network.
- **Model**: Client-Server architecture with separate control and data connections.
- **Purpose**: Moves files from **Server A → Server B** (or vice versa) following a set of predefined rules (ports, encryption, commands).
- **Default Port**: `21` (like SSH uses `22`, DNS uses `53`).

## 🖥️ Lab Setup
- **Two Linux VMs** (CentOS)
  - Example names: `MyFirstLinuxVM` (client) & `LinuxCentOS7` (server)
  - Specs: 1 GB RAM, 10 GB disk, same OS version
- One will act as **FTP Server**, the other as **FTP Client**.

## 🛠️ FTP Server Setup (VSFTPD)

1. **Login as root**  
   ```sh
   su -
   whoami

    Check if VSFTPD is installed

rpm -qa | grep vsftpd

Check internet connection

ping www.google.com

Install FTP server package

yum install vsftpd -y

Backup configuration file

cd /etc/vsftpd
cp vsftpd.conf vsftpd.conf.orig

Edit configuration (vi vsftpd.conf)

    anonymous_enable=NO (disable anonymous login)

    Uncomment ASCII settings:

ascii_upload_enable=YES
ascii_download_enable=YES

Edit banner (optional):

ftpd_banner=Welcome to my FTP server

At the end, add:

    # Local time
    use_localtime=YES

Start & enable service

systemctl start vsftpd
systemctl enable vsftpd
systemctl status vsftpd

Disable firewall for lab (⚠️ not for production)

systemctl stop firewalld
systemctl disable firewalld

(For production, add a firewall rule to allow port 21 instead)

Ensure user exists

    id yourusername || useradd yourusername

💻 FTP Client Setup

    Login as root

su -

Check internet

ping www.google.com

Install FTP client

yum install ftp -y

Verify FTP command works

ftp
bye

Return to normal user

exit

Create a test file

    touch Kruger
    ls -ltr > Kruger   # Add some content
    cat Kruger

📤 File Transfer (Client → Server)

    Find server IP (on server)

ifconfig  # or ip a

Example: 192.168.1.58

Connect via FTP (from client)

ftp 192.168.1.58

    Enter username (default: current user)

    Enter password

Set transfer mode

bin   # binary mode
hash  # show progress with hashes

Upload file

put Kruger

Exit FTP

bye

Verify on server

    ls -ltr  # Should see Kruger file

📝 Key Points to Remember

    Port: FTP uses 21 by default.

    Server Software: vsftpd package.

    Client Software: ftp package.

    Anonymous Access: Disabled for security (anonymous_enable=NO).

    Always use binary mode for file transfers to prevent corruption.

    Firewalls: Open port 21 or disable in a lab.

    Testing: Create a small text file to confirm transfer works.

    Roles: Sender acts as client, receiver acts as server.

✅ After following these steps, you’ll have a fully functional FTP setup between two Linux machines for file transfers.
