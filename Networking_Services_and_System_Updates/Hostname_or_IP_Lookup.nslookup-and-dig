# 🌐 Hostname & IP Address Lookup — Lecture Notes

## 📖 Concept Overview
- **Hostname ↔ IP Address Resolution**  
  - **Forward lookup**: Hostname → IP address.  
  - **Reverse lookup**: IP address → Hostname.
- DNS (Domain Name System) handles the translation between hostnames and IPs.
- Some protocols (e.g., HTTP in a browser, ping) **automatically** perform DNS resolution before sending data.
- Without those protocols, you can manually query DNS using tools like:
  - `nslookup` (available on Linux & Windows)
  - `dig` (default on Linux, available on Windows with extra packages)

## 🛠 Commands for Manual Lookup
### 🔍 `nslookup`
- Interactive or one-shot mode:
  ```bash
  nslookup
  > www.google.com

or

nslookup www.google.com

    Output sections:

        Server: Your current DNS resolver (often your modem/router).

        Address: IP address of the resolver.

        Non-authoritative answer: DNS resolver had to query external servers for the result (did not have cached/authoritative data).

    Authoritative answer: Comes directly from the DNS server responsible for that domain.

Example:

nslookup hotmail.com

Returns:

Server:  <DNS server address>
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    hotmail.com
Address: 204.79.197.212

📡 dig

    More modern and feature-rich than nslookup.

    Syntax:

    dig hotmail.com

    Provides detailed DNS query results:

        QUESTION SECTION: What was asked.

        ANSWER SECTION: Resolved records.

        AUTHORITY SECTION: Authoritative name servers.

        ADDITIONAL SECTION: Extra info like IPs of name servers.

Example:

dig www.facebook.com

Will show IP address(es) for Facebook.
🌍 Practical Examples

    Get the IP address for Facebook:

    nslookup www.facebook.com

    Take the returned IP (e.g., 31.13.71.36) and type it into your browser’s address bar:

        The browser will open Facebook directly via the IP.

    This demonstrates that:

        Internet infrastructure communicates using IP addresses.

        DNS is a convenience for humans to use names instead of remembering numbers.

📝 Key Points

    DNS Port: 53 (UDP for most queries, TCP if response > 512 bytes).

    Resolver: The DNS server your system queries first (often set via DHCP from your ISP/modem).

    Non-authoritative answer: DNS resolver fetched the data from another server, not from its own authoritative data.

    Tools:

        nslookup: Older, simple syntax, still widely available.

        dig: Preferred by many admins today, offers more detail.

    Testing: Use man nslookup or man dig for full usage options.

🧪 Practice Ideas

    Run nslookup and dig on:

        www.google.com

        www.facebook.com

        hotmail.com

    Try reverse lookups:

nslookup 31.13.71.36
dig -x 31.13.71.36
