Central Logger is a server that collects logs from all clients or devices into a single location. It runs the **Rsyslog** service, which is responsible for handling and storing logs. The configuration file for Rsyslog is `/etc/rsyslog.conf`.  

Rsyslog service management:  
- Start/stop/restart with: `systemctl restart rsyslog`  
- Enable at boot: `systemctl enable rsyslog`  

Purpose of Central Logger:  
- Centralized location for logs from multiple systems (Linux, Windows, printers, modems, etc.).  
- Simplifies troubleshooting in large environments with many servers.  
- Avoids the tedious task of logging into each server individually.  

Port and communication:  
- Rsyslog communicates over **UDP port 514** by default.  
- To forward logs from one system to the Central Logger, edit `/etc/rsyslog.conf`:  
  - Uncomment the relevant lines (remove `#`) to enable receiving or sending.  
  - Specify the hostname or IP address of the central server.  

Configuration process:  
1. Verify installation:  
   ```bash
   rpm -qa | grep rsyslog

If missing, install with:

yum install rsyslog

    Edit /etc/rsyslog.conf, enable the correct module and define the central logger.

    Save changes, restart Rsyslog:

systemctl restart rsyslog

Check status:

    systemctl status rsyslog

Benefit: All logs from different devices are aggregated into one central place, improving efficiency and simplifying monitoring.
