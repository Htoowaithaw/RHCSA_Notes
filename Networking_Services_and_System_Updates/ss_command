# 📡 SS Command in Linux

## 📌 What is `ss`?
- **`ss`** = Socket Statistics command.
- Shows active network connections, listening ports, and socket details.
- Useful for troubleshooting network issues and monitoring performance.
- Installed by default in most Linux distros (comes with `iproute2` package).
- Replaces older tool `netstat` (more efficient, more detailed).

---

## 🧠 Simple Analogy
- Think of **sockets** like phone lines between computers/programs.
- `ss` lets you “look inside” these lines to see who’s talking to whom, on what port, and how.
- Helps spot slowdowns, unwanted connections, or network issues.

## 🔌 Types of Sockets
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**  
  Reliable, connection-oriented, used for web, email, file transfers.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**  
  Faster, connectionless, no delivery check, used for streaming, gaming, VoIP.
- **UNIX Sockets**  
  Communication between processes on the same machine (local IPC).

## 📜 Output Columns
When you run `ss`, you’ll see:
1. **Netid** → Protocol (TCP, UDP, UNIX, etc.)
2. **State** → Connection status (e.g., ESTAB, LISTEN)
3. **Recv-Q** → Packets waiting to be received
4. **Send-Q** → Packets waiting to be sent
5. **Local Address:Port** → Your system’s IP/port
6. **Peer Address:Port** → Remote system’s IP/port
7. **Process** → Which process owns the connection

## 🛠 Common `ss` Options
- **Show all connections**  
  ```bash
  ss
  ss | more

    TCP only

ss -t

UDP only

ss -u

UNIX sockets only

ss -x

Listening sockets only

    ss -l

    Combine filters

        TCP + Listening: ss -tl

        TCP + Listening + Numeric output: ss -tln

📝 Examples

    Show TCP listening ports in numeric form:

ss -tln

Show UDP listening ports:

ss -uln

Show UNIX domain sockets:

ss -x

Show which process is using a port:

    ss -tulpn

💡 Tips

    Use man ss to explore all options.

    Combine with filters like grep to find specific ports:

    ss -tln | grep -w ':22'

    ss is fast and can be scripted for monitoring.

    Knowing ss well is essential for Linux system admins and network engineers.

✅ Summary

    ss = Modern replacement for netstat, shows socket/network connection info.

    Useful for diagnosing slow network or unknown connections.

    Supports filtering by protocol, state, port, and more.

    Essential tool for both day-to-day admin work and troubleshooting.
