# 🔐 SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) – Secure File Transfer in Linux

## 🌐 What is SCP?
- **Definition**: SCP transfers computer files securely between hosts over a network.
- **Security**: Encrypts transfer and authentication (unlike FTP, which is plain text by default).
- **Protocol**: Uses **SSH (port 22)** — no separate protocol, piggybacks on SSH.
- **Usage**: Works for:
  - **Client → Server** (upload)
  - **Server → Client** (download)

---

## 🖥️ Lab Setup
- **Two Linux machines**:
  - Client: `MyFirstLinuxVM`
  - Server: `LinuxCentOS7`
- **Client**: Machine where the file originates.
- **Server**: Destination machine where the file will be copied.

## 📦 SCP Workflow (Client → Server)
1. **Prepare file on client**
   ```sh
   cd ~
   touch Jack
   vi Jack
   # Add some content, e.g.:
   Jack is Jerry's uncle

Verify:

ls -ltr
cat Jack

    Get server’s IP

        On the server:

ifconfig enp0s3   # or: ip a

Example output:

    inet 192.168.1.58

Run SCP command from client

scp Jack iafzal@192.168.1.58:/home/iafzal

    Jack → file to transfer.

    iafzal → existing user on the remote server.

    192.168.1.58 → server’s IP.

    /home/iafzal → destination directory on server.

First-time connection prompt:

    Accept server fingerprint by typing yes.

    Enter the remote user’s password.

Transfer output:

    Jack                            100%   22     0.0KB/s   00:00

📥 Verify on Server

    Log in as the target user:

    whoami     # Should be iafzal
    pwd        # Should be /home/iafzal
    ls -ltr    # Should see Jack file
    cat Jack   # Verify file content

🔄 Reverse Transfer (Server → Client)

From client, run:

scp iafzal@192.168.1.58:/home/iafzal/Jack /home/youruser/

📝 Key Points

    Default Port: 22 (same as SSH)

    Authentication: Uses SSH user accounts/passwords or keys.

    Security: Data and credentials encrypted during transfer.

    Direction:

        Upload: scp localfile user@remote:/path/

        Download: scp user@remote:/path/file localpath/

    First-time connection: Requires fingerprint acceptance.

    File paths:

        If omitted, defaults to the user’s home directory.

        Use absolute paths for clarity.

✅ SCP is ideal when you already have SSH access to a server and want a quick, secure file transfer without setting up extra services.
