# RHCSA Notes

This repository contains my personal study notes while preparing for the **Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)** exam.  
The notes are based on **Imran Afzal's RHCSA course on Udemy** and include key concepts, commands, and practice scenarios that I documented during my learning process.
