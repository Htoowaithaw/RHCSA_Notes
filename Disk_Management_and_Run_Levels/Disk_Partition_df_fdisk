🖥️ Disk Partition in Linux
📌 Purpose

Disk partition commands help you check:

Which file systems are partitioned.

Where they are mounted.

The size, usage, and availability of each partition.

🔹 df Command

Stands for disk free.

Shows information about mounted file systems.

Output columns:

Filesystem → device or source.

Size → total capacity.

Used → space already in use.

Avail → remaining free space.

Use% → percentage of disk used.

Mounted on → where it’s mounted in the system.

Useful option:

df -h → human-readable format (GB, MB instead of blocks).

🔹 fdisk Command

Used to view or manage partitions on a disk.

By default, running fdisk without options shows nothing useful.

Common option:

fdisk -l → lists all disks and their partitions.

Typical output includes:

Disk name (e.g., /dev/sda).

Disk size (e.g., 10 GB).

Partitions:

Swap partition (e.g., centos-swap of 1 GB).

Root partition (e.g., /dev/mapper/centos-root around 8.5 GB).

📌 Use Cases

Check available space on each filesystem (df).

See how a disk is divided into partitions (fdisk -l).

Essential when:

Adding a new disk.

Initializing or partitioning a disk.

Mounting partitions to mount points.

✅ Summary:

Use df -h for quick disk usage overview.

Use fdisk -l for detailed partition info.

Together, they help system admins manage storage and troubleshoot disk issues.
