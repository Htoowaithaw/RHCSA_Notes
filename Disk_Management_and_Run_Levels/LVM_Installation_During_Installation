🗄️ Logical Volume Management (LVM) Notes
🔹 What is LVM?

LVM = Logical Volume Management

It is software-based disk management in Linux.

Allows multiple disks to be combined into volume groups (VGs) and divided into logical volumes (LVs).

Provides flexibility for resizing storage without reformatting or breaking partitions.

🔹 How it works (basic flow)

Physical Disks (PVs) → Actual hard disks/SSDs.

Volume Group (VG) → A pool created by combining one or more physical disks.

Example: 3 × 100GB disks = 300GB volume group.

Logical Volumes (LVs) → Partitions created from the volume group.

Example: root, swap, home, data1, data2, etc.

🔹 Example: Single Disk LVM

One disk of 100GB.

Create VG = sysvg.

Inside sysvg, create logical volumes:

/root = 50GB

/home = 30GB

swap = 20GB

🔹 Example: Multi-Disk LVM

Three disks, each 100GB.

Combine them into one VG = datavg (300GB total).

Create LVs inside datavg:

data1 = 100GB

data2 = 50GB

data3 = 75GB

data4 = 75GB

🔹 Key Advantage of LVM

Easily extendable:

If the 300GB VG is full, just add another disk (e.g., +100GB).

The VG becomes 400GB.

You can then extend any logical volume (LV), like data1, without destroying the filesystem.

🔹 Real-World Usage

Common in corporate & virtualized environments.

Example:

A developer’s /root partition is 100GB and fills up to 99%.

Instead of rebuilding the server, you:

Add a new virtual disk.

Extend the volume group.

Extend the root LV from 100GB → 200GB.

This flexibility avoids downtime and simplifies storage management.

✅ In summary:
LVM makes disk space management more flexible, scalable, and dynamic compared to traditional static partitions. It’s especially powerful in servers and virtual machines where resizing storage is a frequent requirement.
