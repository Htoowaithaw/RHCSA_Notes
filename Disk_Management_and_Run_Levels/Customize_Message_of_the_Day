📝 Customize Message of the Day (MOTD)
🔹 What is it?

MOTD = Message of the Day.

Normally set in /etc/motd → displays plain text at login.

But you can customize MOTD to run commands and show system info dynamically.

🔹 Steps to Customize MOTD

Create a script file

Path: /etc/profile.d/motd.sh

Must end with .sh (shell script).

Example content inside motd.sh:

#!/bin/bash (shebang line)

echo statements with commands inside backticks:

Show hostname → hostname

Show OS version → cat /etc/redhat-release

Show kernel version → uname -r

Show logged-in user → whoami

Example output when user logs in:

############################
Welcome to: server1.local
This system is running: CentOS Linux 8
Kernel is: 4.18.0-348.el8.x86_64
You are logged in as: root
############################

Edit SSH configuration

File: /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Find the line: #PrintMotd yes

Uncomment and change it to: PrintMotd no

Why? → This disables /etc/motd and allows your custom script in /etc/profile.d/motd.sh to run instead.

⚠️ Make a backup first:

cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.bak

Restart SSH service

systemctl restart sshd.service

🔹 Verify

Log in again (via PuTTY/SSH).

You should now see the custom MOTD with live command outputs (hostname, OS, kernel, user, etc).

💡 Tips

You can extend MOTD with more system info: memory, disk usage, uptime, etc.

Scripts in /etc/profile.d/ run at login for all users, making it ideal for system-wide messages.

Great for multi-server environments to show which host users are on.
