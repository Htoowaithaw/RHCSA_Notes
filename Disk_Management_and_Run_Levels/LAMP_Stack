# LAMP Stack

## Introduction
The **LAMP stack** is a popular open-source software package for building and deploying **web applications** on Linux-based systems.  
**LAMP** stands for:
- **L** → Linux (Operating System)
- **A** → Apache (Web Server)
- **M** → MySQL / MariaDB (Database)
- **P** → PHP (Scripting Language)

It provides a **secure, stable, and free platform** for hosting web applications like WordPress and other dynamic websites.

## Components Overview
1. **Linux** – Base operating system.
2. **Apache** – Handles HTTP requests and serves web pages.
3. **MySQL / MariaDB** – Manages databases and stores dynamic data.
4. **PHP** – Generates dynamic web content and interacts with the database.

PHP works with MySQL/MariaDB to manage and display **dynamic content** such as:
- Login systems
- Forms
- User dashboards

## LAMP Stack Setup

### **Step 1: Verify Current Services**
Check who you are:
```
whoami
```
Verify hostname and IP:
```
hostname
ip a
```
Check Apache status:
```
systemctl status httpd
```
Check MariaDB status:
```
systemctl status mariadb
```

If either service is not installed, use `dnf install` to add them.

---

### **Step 2: Install PHP**
Install PHP and required modules:
```
dnf install php php-mysqlnd php-cli -y
```
- **php-cli** → Run PHP commands from terminal.
- **php-mysqlnd** → Allows PHP to communicate with MySQL/MariaDB.

Restart Apache to recognize PHP:
```
systemctl restart httpd
```

---

### **Step 3: Test PHP Installation**
Navigate to the default web directory:
```
cd /var/www/html
```
Create a test file:
```
vi info.php
```
Add the following PHP code:
```php
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
```
Open browser and visit:
```
http://<your-ip-address>/info.php
```
Example: `http://192.168.100.192/info.php`

If you see PHP details, installation is successful.

---

### **Step 4: Create Database in MariaDB**
Log into MariaDB as root:
```
mysql -u root -p
```
Create a test database:
```
CREATE DATABASE testdb;
```
Exit MariaDB:
```
exit;
```

---

### **Step 5: Create PHP Script to Connect to Database**
Create a new PHP file:
```
vi database_connect.php
```
Add the following code:
```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = ""; // Add root password if set
$dbname = "testdb";

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
echo "Successfully connected to the database";
?>
```

---

### **Step 6: Test Database Connection**
Open browser and visit:
```
http://<your-ip-address>/database_connect.php
```
- If successful: Displays `Successfully connected to the database`.
- If error occurs: Update `$password` with the correct root password.

## Summary
- **LAMP Stack** combines Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, and PHP for a powerful web hosting platform.
- You tested:
  1. PHP installation with `phpinfo()`.
  2. Database connection using a custom PHP script.
- LAMP is used to host dynamic web applications like **WordPress**, **Drupal**, and custom sites.
