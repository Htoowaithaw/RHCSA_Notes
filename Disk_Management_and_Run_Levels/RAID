RAID Basics (RAID 0, 1, and 5)
What is RAID?

RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent (or Inexpensive) Disks.

Purpose: To provide redundancy and fault tolerance.

If one disk fails, data is not lost.

Also improves performance depending on the RAID level.

Why RAID?

Data protection: Prevents complete data loss if a disk dies.

Used in servers, enterprise storage systems, and critical production environments.

Common RAID Levels
1. RAID 0 – Striping

Combines two or more disks into one larger disk.

Example:

Two disks: 5 GB + 5 GB = 10 GB total.

How it works:

Data is split (striped) across both disks for faster performance.

Advantage:

Very fast read and write speeds.

Disadvantage:

No redundancy.

If one disk fails, all data is lost.

Best for:

Temporary data storage like backups, data warehousing, or non-critical data.

2. RAID 1 – Mirroring

Two disks of equal size, but data is mirrored.

Example:

Two disks: 5 GB + 5 GB = 5 GB usable.

How it works:

Data is written identically to both disks.

Advantage:

High redundancy — if one disk fails, the other has a complete copy.

Disadvantage:

Slower performance because every write must be duplicated.

Storage is halved (50% usable space).

Best for:

Critical systems where data integrity is more important than speed.

3. RAID 5 – Striping with Parity

Requires minimum of three disks.

Example:

Three disks: 5 GB each = 15 GB total → Usable space ≈ 10–12 GB.

How it works:

Data is striped like RAID 0, but parity information is also distributed across all disks.

If one disk fails, data can be reconstructed from parity.

Parity rotates among disks in a round-robin pattern.

Advantage:

Fault tolerance — survives failure of one disk.

Good balance between speed and redundancy.

Disadvantage:

Slightly slower write performance due to parity calculations.

Best for:

Servers or environments needing both performance and redundancy.

RAID vs LVM
Feature	RAID	LVM
Configured on	Physical disks	Virtual/logical disks
Purpose	Data redundancy & fault tolerance	Flexible volume management
Typical Use Case	Hardware servers, physical storage arrays	Virtualized environments, dynamic resizing

Summary

RAID 0: Speed only → No redundancy → All data lost if one disk fails.

RAID 1: Mirroring → High redundancy → Slower writes, 50% storage loss.

RAID 5: Speed + Redundancy → Needs minimum 3 disks, tolerates 1 disk failure.

RAID is a hardware-level solution, while LVM is for logical volume management.
