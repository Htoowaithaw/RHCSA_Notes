🐧 Linux Boot Process – Notes
🔹 Why Learn This?

Important for understanding how Linux starts after pressing the power button.

Common interview question: “Explain the Linux boot process.”

🔹 6 Main Stages of Linux Boot

BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)

Runs when you press power.

Performs system integrity checks.

Looks for a boot device (HDD, CD-ROM, USB, etc.).

Loads the Boot Loader.

MBR (Master Boot Record)

Located in the first sector of the bootable disk (/dev/sda or /dev/hda).

Very small (~512 bytes).

Contains info about GRUB.

GRUB (Grand Unified Boot Loader)

Lets you choose between multiple kernel versions.

Config files: /boot/grub/grub.cfg.

Can modify to change boot order or default kernel.

Kernel

Mounts the root filesystem (defined in grub.cfg).

Executes /sbin/init.

Uses initrd (Initial RAM Disk) as a temporary root filesystem until real one mounts.

initrd contains drivers needed for hardware & disk access.

Init

First process started by kernel (/sbin/init).

Reads /etc/inittab to decide the runlevel.

Runlevels:

0 → Halt (shutdown)

1 → Single-user mode

2 → Multi-user, no networking

3 → Full multi-user, CLI only

4 → Unused

5 → Multi-user with GUI (X11)

6 → Reboot

Runlevel Programs

Located in /etc/rc.d/rc*.d/.

Scripts are started/stopped depending on the runlevel.

Example: Runlevel 5 → starts GUI (display manager) + network.

🔹 Quick Commands to Check

who -r → Show current runlevel.

ls /etc/rc.d/ → View runlevel scripts.

init 3 → Switch to runlevel 3 (no GUI).

init 5 → Switch back to runlevel 5 (GUI).

🔹 Summary

Boot sequence: BIOS → MBR → GRUB → Kernel → Init → Runlevels → Login prompt.

Knowing this sequence helps in troubleshooting startup issues and is a frequent interview topic.
