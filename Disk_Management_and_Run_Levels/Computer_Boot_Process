🖥️ Computer Boot Process – Notes
🔹 Overview

The boot process is how a computer powers on and starts the operating system.

Steps are similar across all computers and operating systems.

🔹 Step-by-Step Boot Process

Power On

Electricity flows from the socket to the motherboard.

First component to power up: CPU.

BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)

CPU looks for instructions in the BIOS.

BIOS is a small program stored on a chip called ROM (Read-Only Memory).

ROM = factory set, cannot be modified.

CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor)

Stores BIOS settings (time, date, hardware config).

Powered by a small battery on the motherboard so settings are not lost when power is off.

POST (Power-On Self-Test)

BIOS tells CPU to check all attached devices (keyboard, RAM, disk, etc.).

Ensures devices are working.

If any major fault → boot process stops.

Disk Access (MBR)

BIOS looks for the disk defined in CMOS settings.

Reads the first sector: MBR (Master Boot Record).

MBR contains information about the operating system.

Load Operating System

The OS is loaded into RAM (memory).

OS takes over control.

OS decides which services/programs to start first.

CPU executes instructions from OS.

🔹 Bootstrap Process

The entire sequence CPU → BIOS → CMOS → POST → MBR → OS loaded into RAM is called Bootstrap.

"Bootstrap" = process of starting a computer and handing control to the OS.

🔹 Key Terms Recap

BIOS → Instructions stored in ROM.

CMOS → Stores BIOS settings, powered by battery.

POST → Hardware self-test.

MBR → Master Boot Record, first sector of disk.

Bootstrap → Full boot sequence leading to OS load.
