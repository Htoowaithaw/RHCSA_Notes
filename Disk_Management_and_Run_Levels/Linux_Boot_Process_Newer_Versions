🐧 Linux Boot Process (systemd – RHEL 7+/CentOS 7+)
🔹 Why Important?

Newer versions of Linux (CentOS/RHEL 7 and above) use systemd instead of the old SysV init.

System administrators must know the sequence to troubleshoot boot issues.

🔹 Boot Process Steps

Firmware (BIOS/UEFI)

Runs immediately when system powers on.

Performs POST (Power-On Self-Test): checks hardware (CPU, RAM, storage, etc.).

Hands control to the boot device.

MBR (Master Boot Record)

Stored in first sector of the bootable disk.

Very small but contains info about GRUB2 location.

GRUB2 (Grand Unified Boot Loader v2)

Loads the Linux kernel.

Config file: /boot/grub2/grub.cfg.

Allows selecting between multiple kernels if available.

Kernel

Core of the OS.

Loads drivers from initrd.img (initial RAM disk).

Ensures hardware (disks, network, etc.) can communicate properly.

Starts the first OS process → systemd.

systemd (PID 1)

New init system replacing SysV in RHEL 7+.

Manages all other services/processes.

Reads etc/systemd/system/default.target to decide boot target (runlevel equivalent).

Examples of targets:

graphical.target → Multi-user + GUI

multi-user.target → Multi-user CLI

rescue.target → Single-user (troubleshooting)

System Online

systemd launches enabled services.

System reaches the defined default target (equivalent to old runlevel).

You get the login prompt (CLI or GUI depending on target).

🔹 Runlevels vs Targets (systemd mapping)

0 → poweroff.target

1 → rescue.target

2 → multi-user.target (no networking in older SysV, now same as 3)

3 → multi-user.target

4 → unused (custom)

5 → graphical.target

6 → reboot.target

🔹 Summary

Boot order: BIOS → POST → MBR → GRUB2 → Kernel → systemd → Default Target.

systemd replaced init in RHEL 7+ and manages services & targets.

Knowing this flow is essential for troubleshooting boot failures.
