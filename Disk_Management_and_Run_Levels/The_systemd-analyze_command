🖥️ Linux Systemd-Analyze Command Notes
📌 What is Systemd-Analyze?

Part of the Systemd package.

Used to analyze boot performance and system startup.

Shows how long the kernel, initrd (initial RAM disk), and user space take to load.

Identifies slowest services (critical chain) and services by startup time (blame list).

Can generate graphical boot charts, check configuration errors, and assess service security.

Helpful for troubleshooting and optimizing Linux system startup.

🕘 History

2010: Developed as part of the Systemd project (by Lennart Poettering).

2014: Included in RHEL 7 / CentOS 7.

Still widely used today for analyzing boot processes.

⚙️ Key Features & Commands

View manual page:
man systemd-analyze
(Shows ~20 parameters and options with examples.)

Show total boot time:
systemd-analyze time

Example result:

Kernel: 2s

Initrd: 5s

User space: 17s

GUI ready: after 17s in user space

Show services and their startup times (blame list):
systemd-analyze blame

Example: firewalld.service → 860ms

Filter blame output for current user only:
systemd-analyze blame --user

Example: shows only 4 user-specific processes.

🔍 Why Use Systemd-Analyze?

Detects which services slow down boot.

Helps sysadmins and engineers troubleshoot performance.

Can be mentioned in interviews as part of system troubleshooting experience.

✅ Summary

Systemd-Analyze is a Linux tool to:

Measure boot-up time (kernel, initrd, user space).

Identify slow services.

Optimize and troubleshoot system performance.

👉 Practice: Run systemd-analyze on your own Linux machine to see what affects your boot time.
