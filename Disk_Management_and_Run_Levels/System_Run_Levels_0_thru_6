ðŸ“˜ System Run Levels in Linux â€“ Notes
ðŸ”¹ What are Run Levels?

Run levels define the mode in which a Linux system operates.

Similar to Windows "Safe Mode," but Linux has multiple modes.

Controlled by the init command (older SysV systems).

ðŸ”¹ Common Run Levels

0 â†’ Halt (shuts down the system, powers it off)

1 (or s/S) â†’ Single-user mode (used for troubleshooting, maintenance, password reset, no networking)

2 â†’ Multi-user mode without networking

3 â†’ Multi-user mode with networking (no GUI, CLI only)

5 â†’ Multi-user mode with networking and GUI (most desktops run here)

6 â†’ Reboot (same as running reboot command)

ðŸ”¹ Useful Commands

init 0 â†’ Shutdown

init 1 or init s â†’ Single-user mode

init 3 â†’ Multi-user with network, no GUI

init 5 â†’ Multi-user with GUI

init 6 â†’ Reboot

ðŸ”¹ Check Current Run Level

Use who -r to see the current run level.

ðŸ”¹ Key Points

Servers often use run level 3 (no GUI, networking only).

Desktops usually use run level 5 (with GUI).

Always be root to change run levels.

Practice switching between run levels to understand the difference.
