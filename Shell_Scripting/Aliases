# 📝 Linux Aliases – Shortcuts for Commands

## 📌 What is an Alias?
- An alias in Linux is a shortcut or nickname for a longer, repetitive command.
- Makes commands easier to remember and faster to type.
- Real-life analogy:
  - **50 Cent** → Real name: Curtis James
  - **Pitbull** → Real name: Armando Perez
  - Aliases in Linux work the same way: short, memorable names for long commands.

---

## 🎯 Why Use Aliases?
- Save time when running frequently used commands.
- Avoid typing long, complex command strings repeatedly.
- Combine multiple commands into one shortcut.

## 🛠 Creating and Using Aliases

### Example 1: Simple Alias
1. Without alias:  
   `ls -al` → Shows all files (including hidden ones) in long listing format.
2. Create alias:  
   `alias l="ls -al"`
3. Run `l` → Same output as `ls -al`.

---

### Example 2: Two Commands in One
1. Without alias:  
   `pwd` (print working directory)  
   `ls` (list files)
2. Create alias:  
   `alias pl="pwd; ls"`
3. Run `pl` → Executes both commands in sequence.

---

### Example 3: Three Commands
- Suggested practice: Create an alias to run:
  - `whoami`
  - `hostname`
  - `pwd`
- Syntax:  
  `alias whp="whoami; hostname; pwd"`

---

### Example 4: List Only Directories
1. Command:  
   `ls -l | grep ^d`  
   - `grep ^d` → Filters output to only show entries starting with `d` (directories).
2. Alias:  
   `alias dir="ls -l | grep ^d"`
3. Run `dir` → Lists only directories in the current location.

---

### Example 5: Complex Command with Variables
1. Command sequence:
   - `df -h` → Shows disk partitions, size, usage, and mount points.
   - `awk '{print $6}'` → Prints the 6th column (mount points).
   - `cut -c1-4` → Shows only the first 4 characters of each line.
2. Problem: `$6` is treated as a shell variable in aliases — needs escaping with `\$6`.
3. Alias:  
   `alias d="df -h | awk '{print \$6}' | cut -c1-4"`
4. Run `d` → Displays shortened mount point names.

---

## 📋 Viewing Aliases
- `alias` → Lists all aliases currently active in the session.

---

## ❌ Removing Aliases
- `unalias <name>` → Removes the specified alias.
- Example:  
  - `unalias d`
  - `unalias dir`
- Run `alias` again to verify they are gone.

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- Aliases = shortcuts for long or repetitive commands.
- Can combine multiple commands in one alias.
- Escape `$` when dealing with variables in alias definitions.
- Aliases are temporary — they only last for the current session unless added to shell configuration files (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`).
- Removing aliases is as simple as using `unalias`.

---

## 🧠 Practice Ideas
- Create a personal `ll` alias for `ls -lh`.
- Make an alias to quickly navigate to your most-used directory.
- Combine commands like backup + compress into one alias.
