# 🐧 Linux Shell Scripting – Beginner Notes (Imran Afzal)

## 📚 Introduction
Shell scripting is fun, powerful, and a great way to start programming on Linux. In this session, we’ll:
- Write simple shell scripts
- Use basic shell commands like `echo`, `whoami`, `pwd`, `hostname`
- Automate tasks using variables and logic
- Learn troubleshooting techniques

---

## 📁 Step 1: Create a Script Folder

```bash
# Check your current directory
pwd

# Make a new directory
mkdir myscripts

# Move into the directory
cd myscripts

# Confirm it's empty
ls

✏️ Step 2: Your First Shell Script (Output to Screen)

# Create a file using vi
vi output-screen

Inside vi, press i and type:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World"

Press Esc, then type :wq to save and exit.

Make it executable:

chmod +x output-screen

Run it:

./output-screen

Expected output:

Hello World

✅ Congrats — you just ran your first shell script!
🧪 Step 3: Another Script with Multiple Commands

Create a new file:

vi run-commands

Insert the following:

#!/bin/bash

# This script runs small tasks
# Written by Imran Afzal
# Date: 2018

whoami
echo
pwd
hostname
ls -ltr

Save and exit. Then:

chmod +x run-commands
./run-commands

📝 Why use echo? → It creates a blank line for better output readability.
💡 Step 4: Using Variables in Shell Script

Create a file:

vi variable-command

Insert this content:

#!/bin/bash

# Variable Example Script
a="Imran"
b="Afzal"
c='Linux class'

echo "My first name is $a"
echo "My surname is $b"
echo 'My class is' $c

Make it executable and run:

chmod +x variable-command
./variable-command

Expected output:

My first name is Imran
My surname is Afzal
My class is Linux class

🧩 Troubleshooting Tip:
If you see an error like line 6: command not found, check:

    Quotation marks (" vs ')

    Spacing in variables (use quotes if values contain spaces)

    Line numbers mentioned in errors

🔁 Bonus: Run Script from Absolute Path

/home/username/myscripts/output-screen

✅ No need for ./ if using absolute path.
🧠 Recap

You’ve just learned:

    How to create and run shell scripts

    How to use chmod +x to make them executable

    How to print to screen with echo

    How to use variables inside scripts

    How to troubleshoot basic errors

🧪 Challenge: Try Creating Scripts That…

    Print system info (IP, uptime, CPU, RAM)

    Create multiple files/directories

    Search logs using grep, awk, cut, sort, uniq

    Backup a directory into a .tar file

🧑‍💻 Happy scripting!
