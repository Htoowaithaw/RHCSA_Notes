📝 Linux Aliases – User & Global Aliases

Aliases in Linux are shortcuts for commands (for example, typing ll instead of ls -al). By default, aliases created with the alias command are temporary — they last only for the current terminal session. Once you log out or close your terminal/SSH session, they disappear. To make aliases permanent, they need to be saved in configuration files that are loaded whenever a shell session starts.

There are two types of persistent aliases:

1. User Aliases – These apply only to a specific user account and are saved in that user’s ~/.bashrc file (the home directory). Only that user will have access to them.

2. Global Aliases – These apply to all users on the system and are saved in /etc/bashrc. Any user who logs in will be able to use them.
🔹 Creating a Temporary Alias (Session Only)

Example: Create hh to run hostname
alias hh="hostname"
Checking aliases in the current session: alias
Now running hh will display the system hostname. This alias will disappear after logging out or starting a new session.
👤 Creating a User Alias (Persistent for One User)

    Log in as the target user.

    Open the ~/.bashrc file in the home directory using a text editor.

    Add the alias at the end of the file, for example:
    # Personal Aliases
    alias hh="hostname"

    Save and close the file.

    Open a new terminal session or reload the file with source ~/.bashrc.

    Now hh works in any session for this user.

🌍 Creating a Global Alias (Persistent for All Users)

    Log in as root (required to edit system configuration files).

    Open /etc/bashrc in a text editor.

    Add the alias at the end of the file, for example:
    # Global Aliases
    alias hh="hostname"

    Save and close the file.

    Open a new terminal session for changes to take effect.

    Test by logging in as any user — the alias should work system-wide.

🧪 Testing a Global Alias with a New User

    Create a new user: useradd james and set their password.

    Log in as james in a new terminal session.

    Run hh — the hostname should display, showing that the global alias works for all accounts.

📋 Viewing and Removing Aliases

    View all active aliases: alias

    Remove an alias: unalias hh

💡 Key Points to Remember

    Temporary aliases vanish after logout.

    User aliases belong in ~/.bashrc for one account only.

    Global aliases belong in /etc/bashrc for everyone.

    Changes require either a new session or reloading the configuration file with source.

    Use comments in .bashrc or /etc/bashrc to keep aliases organized.

🧠 Practice Ideas

    Create a dir alias for ls -l | grep ^d in your ~/.bashrc.

    Make a sysinfo global alias for uname -a.

    Add multiple aliases for commands you use frequently, such as updates, navigation, or backups.
