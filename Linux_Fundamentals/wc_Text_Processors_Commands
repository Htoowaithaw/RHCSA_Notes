# 🔢 Linux `wc` Command – Word, Line & Byte Counter

The `wc` (word count) command in Linux is a simple but powerful utility that **counts lines, words, and bytes** in a file or from command output.

---

## 📘 What It Does

- Counts:
  - 🧾 **Lines**
  - 📝 **Words**
  - 📦 **Bytes**
- Accepts input from a **file** or **command pipeline**

---

## 🛠 Syntax
```bash
wc [options] filename
⚙️ Common Options
Option	Description
-l	Count lines
-w	Count words
-c	Count bytes

📌 Note: -c counts bytes, not characters.

🧪 Example: Count from File
Assume seinfeld-characters contains several character names.

bash
Copy
Edit
wc seinfeld-characters
Output:

bash
Copy
Edit
17 34 236 seinfeld-characters
# ↑   ↑   ↑
# |   |   └─ Bytes
# |   └───── Words
# └───────── Lines
🔍 Count Specific Info Only
bash
Copy
Edit
wc -l seinfeld-characters    # Lines: 17
wc -w seinfeld-characters    # Words: 34
wc -c seinfeld-characters    # Bytes: 236
❗️ wc -b is invalid — use -c for byte count.

🧾 Count from Command Output
📄 Count Files in a Directory
bash
Copy
Edit
ls -l | wc -l
Includes the total line, so subtract 1:

bash
Copy
Edit
expr $(ls -l | wc -l) - 1
📁 Count Only Directories
bash
Copy
Edit
ls -l | grep '^d' | wc -l
^d = lines starting with d (i.e. directories)

Skips the total line automatically

🧠 Optional exercise: Try find . -type d | wc -l to count subdirectories recursively.

🔎 Count Matching Lines with grep
bash
Copy
Edit
grep "Seinfeld" seinfeld-characters | wc -l
Counts how many lines match "Seinfeld"

💡 Pro Tips
Combine wc with grep, ls, or cat for insights

Always check wc --help or man wc for detailed options

Use awk or cut if you need to count specific fields
