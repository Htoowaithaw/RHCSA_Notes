# 🧰 Linux Text Processing: Filter Commands Overview

This lecture introduces essential **text processing commands** in Linux, commonly used in filtering and formatting output in shell scripting and command-line tasks.

## 📋 Commands Covered

- **`cut`** – Extracts specific sections from each line of input (e.g., specific fields or characters).
- **`awk`** – Pattern scanning and processing language; ideal for **column-based** operations.
- **`grep` / `egrep`** – Searches for patterns/keywords in text.  
  Example: `grep "warning" file.txt` → finds lines containing "warning".
- **`sort`** – Sorts lines of text (alphabetically, numerically, etc.).
- **`uniq`** – Removes **duplicate adjacent lines** from sorted input.
- **`wc`** (word count) – Displays **number of lines, words, and characters** in a file/output.

## 🧠 Key Points

- Each command will be explained in its own dedicated lecture.
- Practical examples will help solidify understanding.
- Useful for log analysis, automation, parsing, and more.
