# 🪄 Linux File Combining and Splitting

## 🧩 What Can You Do?
- ✅ Combine multiple files into one
- ✅ Split one file into multiple smaller files

---

## 🔗 Combine Files

### 🧪 Example: Combine file1, file2, file3 into file4
```bash
cat file1 file2 file3 > file4
This merges the contents of all three files into file4.

Useful when you want to aggregate logs, text, or data from different files.

✂️ Split a File
📦 Why Split?
The original file is too large to send or upload.

You want to process the file in chunks.

You’re sending logs/data to a third party and want to separate sections.

🔧 Command Syntax
bash
Copy
Edit
split -l [NUMBER_OF_LINES] [INPUT_FILE] [OUTPUT_PREFIX]
🧪 Example:
Split countries file into chunks of 2 lines each, prefix with sep:

bash
Copy
Edit
split -l 2 countries sep
🔍 Output:
Linux will automatically generate files like:

sepaa

sepab

sepac

sepad
Each file contains 2 lines (except the last if lines aren’t evenly divisible).

🧪 Practice Scenario
Step 1: Create a file with 7 country names
bash
Copy
Edit
echo "USA" > countries
echo "UK" >> countries
echo "UAE" >> countries
echo "Canada" >> countries
echo "France" >> countries
echo "Switzerland" >> countries
echo "Japan" >> countries
Step 2: Verify content
bash
Copy
Edit
cat countries
wc -l countries   # Should show 7 lines
Step 3: Split into 2-line chunks
bash
Copy
Edit
split -l 2 countries sep
Step 4: Check outputs
bash
Copy
Edit
cat sepaa    # USA, UK
cat sepab    # UAE, Canada
cat sepac    # France, Switzerland
cat sepad    # Japan (alone)
🤔 Why is Japan alone?
Total lines = 7 (not divisible by 2)

So the last chunk only contains 1 line

Linux doesn't add padding — just creates as many full chunks as possible
