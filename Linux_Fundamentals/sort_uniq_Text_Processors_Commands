# üìö Linux `sort` and `uniq` Commands ‚Äì Clean and Analyze Text Data

The `sort` and `uniq` commands are essential text-processing tools used to **organize** and **deduplicate** data in Linux.

---

## üîÑ `sort` Command ‚Äì Alphabetical Sorting

### üìò What It Does:
- Sorts lines of text **alphabetically** (default: A ‚Üí Z)
- Supports reverse sort, sorting by field, numeric sorting, etc.

### üõ† Syntax:
```bash
sort [options] filename
üß™ Common Examples:
bash
Copy
Edit
sort seinfeld-characters              # Sort lines A ‚Üí Z
sort -r seinfeld-characters          # Sort in reverse order (Z ‚Üí A)
sort -k2 seinfeld-characters         # Sort by the 2nd field (e.g. last names)
üí° Use with output of other commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls -l | sort                         # Sort file list by first column
ls -l | sort -k9                     # Sort by the 9th column (file/directory name)
üîÅ uniq Command ‚Äì Remove Duplicate Lines
üìò What It Does:
Filters out adjacent duplicate lines

Must be used after sort to group duplicates together

üõ† Syntax:
bash
Copy
Edit
uniq [options] filename
üß™ Common Examples:
bash
Copy
Edit
sort seinfeld-characters | uniq              # Remove duplicates
sort seinfeld-characters | uniq -c           # Count occurrences
sort seinfeld-characters | uniq -d           # Show only duplicate lines
üìå Always sort before uniq:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat seinfeld-characters | sort | uniq
üß† Practical Tips
sort without -k ‚Üí sorts by the entire line starting at the first character

sort -kN ‚Üí sort by Nth field (useful for structured text)

uniq -c ‚Üí adds count of occurrences before each line

uniq -d ‚Üí shows only the lines that appear more than once

üîó Combine with Other Commands
bash
Copy
Edit
ls -l | sort -k9 | uniq
Sorts ls output by file name (column 9)

Removes duplicate lines

üí° Bonus: Add Duplicate for Testing
To test uniq behavior, add a duplicate:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "Jerry Seinfeld" >> seinfeld-characters
Then try:

bash
Copy
Edit
sort seinfeld-characters | uniq -c
