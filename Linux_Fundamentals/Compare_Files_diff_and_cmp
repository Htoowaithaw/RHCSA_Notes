# 🧾 Linux `diff` and `cmp` – Compare Files Efficiently

In Linux, you can quickly compare the **contents of two files** using the `diff` and `cmp` commands. These are essential tools for tracking changes, debugging, and validating file contents.

---

## 🔍 `diff` – Compare Line by Line

### 📘 What It Does:
- Compares **two files line by line**
- Shows **differences** between lines
- Outputs which lines are different in **file1 vs file2**

### 🛠 Syntax:
```bash
diff file1 file2
🧪 Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
diff superman-characters superman-characters2
Output:

yaml
Copy
Edit
3c3
< Journal Zod
---
> Journal Peter
This means line 3 is different:

In file1: Journal Zod

In file2: Journal Peter

🔎 cmp – Compare Byte by Byte
📘 What It Does:
Compares two files byte-by-byte

Reports the first differing byte and line

More low-level than diff

🛠 Syntax:
bash
Copy
Edit
cmp file1 file2
🧪 Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
cmp superman-characters superman-characters2
Output:

arduino
Copy
Edit
superman-characters superman-characters2 differ: byte 46, line 3
It tells you where the difference is — down to the byte and line.

🛠 Setup Example Files
bash
Copy
Edit
echo "Clark Kent" > superman-characters
echo "Lois Lane" >> superman-characters
echo "Journal Zod" >> superman-characters

echo "Clark Kent" > superman-characters2
echo "Lois Lane" >> superman-characters2
echo "Journal Peter" >> superman-characters2
Now run diff and cmp on them.

💡 Tips
diff is best for human-readable comparisons

cmp is great for binary or byte-level checks

Use man diff and man cmp to explore advanced options

✅ Summary

Command	Description
diff file1 file2	Show line-by-line differences
cmp file1 file2	Show byte and line where first difference occurs
