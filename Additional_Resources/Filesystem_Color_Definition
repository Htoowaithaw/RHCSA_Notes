# ðŸŒˆ Filesystem Color Definitions in Linux

When you run commands like `ls -ltr` or `ls -l`, files and directories in Linux are displayed in **different colors**.  
These colors help identify the type and state of files at a glance.

---

## **Color Guide**
| **Color**           | **Meaning** |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Blue**            | Directory |
| **Green**           | Executable file or recognized script (`chmod +x`) |
| **Sky Blue (Cyan)** | Symbolic link |
| **Yellow with Black Background** | Device files (e.g., `/dev/`) like keyboard, mouse, network card |
| **Pink**            | Image/graphic files (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`) |
| **Red**             | Archive/compressed files (e.g., `.tar`, `.gz`) |
| **Red with Black Background** | Broken symbolic link |

---

## **Examples**

### **1. Blue â€“ Directory**
- Directories always appear in blue.
- Verified by the first column showing **`d`** in permissions.

```bash
ls -ltr
# Output example:
drwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Sep 10 12:00 my_folder
```

---

### **2. Green â€“ Executable Files**
- Files with **`x` (executable)** permission are green.
- Example:
```bash
chmod +x script.sh
ls -ltr
# script.sh will now appear green
```

Removing execute permission will turn it back to white:
```bash
chmod a-x script.sh
```

---

### **3. Sky Blue â€“ Symbolic Links**
Create a symbolic link:
```bash
ln -s /home/user/file.txt /tmp/file_link
```
- The link will show in **sky blue**.

---

### **4. Yellow â€“ Device Files**
- Found under `/dev/`, e.g., `tty`, `sda`, etc.
- These start with **`c`** (character device) or **`b`** (block device) in permissions.

```bash
cd /dev
ls -ltr
```

---

### **5. Pink â€“ Image Files**
- Graphic files like `.jpg` or `.gif` appear in **pink**.

Download an image to test:
```bash
wget <image-url>
ls -ltr
# The downloaded image will show in pink
```

> Images cannot be viewed in SSH terminal, only on a GUI.

---

### **6. Red â€“ Archive Files**
- Archive files like `.tar` or `.gz` appear in **red**.

Example:
```bash
tar cvf all.tar A B C D
ls -ltr
# all.tar will appear red
```

---

### **7. Red with Black Background â€“ Broken Link**
- A broken symbolic link shows **red text with black background**.

Example of broken link creation:
```bash
ln -s ihulk /tmp/ihulk   # Missing absolute source path
```

Fix by specifying absolute path:
```bash
rm /tmp/ihulk
ln -s /home/user/ihulk /tmp/ihulk
```

## **Tips**
- Not all Linux systems have identical colors.
- Avoid modifying color settings to maintain consistency across environments.
- Use `ls -ltr` to display files with timestamps and reverse order (newest at the bottom).

## **Summary**
Linux uses colors to visually indicate file types and statuses:
- **Blue** â†’ Directory  
- **Green** â†’ Executable  
- **Sky Blue** â†’ Symbolic Link  
- **Yellow** â†’ Device File  
- **Pink** â†’ Image File  
- **Red** â†’ Archive File  
- **Red with Black Background** â†’ Broken Link  

These visual cues help you quickly identify and troubleshoot files in your system.
