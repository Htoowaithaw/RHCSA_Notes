# üåê IP Address Assigned but Not Reachable

When your system has an IP address assigned but you **cannot reach it**, follow these troubleshooting steps to identify and fix the issue.

---

## **Troubleshooting Steps**

1. **Check the Network Interface**
   - Run `ifconfig` or `ip addr` to confirm the interface is active and has the correct IP.
   - Example:

     ip addr show

     Look for the interface status ‚Äî it should be **UP**.

2. **Verify Subnet Mask and Gateway**
   - Ensure the correct subnet mask and gateway are configured in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/` or via `nmcli`.

3. **Ping the Gateway**
   ping -c 4 <gateway-ip>

   If it fails, there may be a gateway or network issue.

4. **Check Gateway Assignment**
   netstat -rnv

   - Confirms the default gateway is correctly set.

5. **Verify VLAN Settings**
   - Ask the network team if the **correct VLAN** is assigned on the switch port.

6. **Check NIC (Network Interface Card) Status**
   ethtool <interface-name>

   or
   mii-tool <interface-name>


7. **Bring Interface Up**
   ifup <interface-name>


8. **Restart Network Service**
   sudo systemctl restart network


9. **Check for IP Conflicts**
   - Run `arp-scan` or disconnect other devices to ensure no two devices share the same IP.

10. **Turn Off Firewall Temporarily**
    
    sudo systemctl stop firewalld

## **Simple Example**

- Server IP: `192.168.1.10`
- Gateway: `192.168.1.1`

### Steps:
1. Verify interface status:
   ip addr show

2. Ping the gateway:
   ping -c 4 192.168.1.1

3. If ping fails, check routes:
   netstat -rnv

4. Bring the NIC up:
   ifup eth0

5. Restart network service if needed:
   systemctl restart network


---

## **Summary**
- Most connectivity issues happen due to incorrect gateway, VLAN mismatch, or NIC being down.
- Always test **basic connectivity** (ping, routes) before diving deeper.
